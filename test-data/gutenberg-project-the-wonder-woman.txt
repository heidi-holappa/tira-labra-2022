THE WONDER WOMAN




CHAPTER I

TWO WOMEN


DO you see her now, Mr. David?

I nodded, pointing into the coals. I see a lion, and an old witch, and
a monkey. I dont see any woman.

There! There! I cried. Shes just going through the postern gate.
Oh, shes gone, lad! Never mind! Next time you may see her.

And is she prettiern Wanza, Mr. David?

Perhaps not prettier, I responded. Wanza looking out from beneath
the pink-lined umbrella on her peddlers cart is very charming, indeed.
But the woman I see in the fire is--oh, shes altogether different!

This was the customary tenor of my conversation with Joey as we sat
before our fire of pine knots of an evening. The lad would point out to
me queer kaleidoscopic creatures he saw deep in the heart of the pine
fire; but his young eyes never saw the face I beheld there, and so I
was obliged to describe my wonder woman to him.

It was not strange that Joey should share my confidence in this
fashion. He had been my sole companion since the night four years
before when I had found him--poor tiny lad--sobbing on the doorstep
of a shack some three miles down the river. I had lifted him to my
shoulder and entered the shack to find there a dying woman. The woman
died that night, but before she passed away she gave the child to
me, saying: He is only a waif! I took him from my poor brother when
he died over on the Sound, about six months ago. My brother was a
fisherman. He picked the child up on the beach one morning after a
fierce storm a year ago. I was meaning to keep the boy always, poor as
I be. But now--you take Joey, mister,--hell be a blessing to you!

A blessing! I said the words over to myself as I carried the boy home
that night. I said them to myself when I awakened in the morning and
looked down at him cradled in the hollow of my arm. I had been out of
conceit with life. For me the world was jagged and broken in very
truth. But looking down at the young stranger I thrilled with the
sudden desire to smooth and shape my days again. To stand sure! And
here was a companion for me! I was through with living alone!

I went to the window, threw it wide, and saw the dawn rosy in the east.
A mountain bluebird that had a nest in a hole in a cottonwood tree hard
by was perched on a serviceberry bush beside the window. I heard its
song with rapture. I was smiling when I turned back to the bunk where I
had left the child. The child was smiling too. He sat straight up among
the blankets, his eyes were fixed on the bird, and he was holding out
his little arms. I lifted him and carried him to the window, and he
lisped: I love birdie! I love you!

And so Joey became my boy.

It was not only in the heart of the pine fire that I saw the radiant
creature I described to Joey. When I looked from my workshop door at
twilight across the shadowy river to the cool purple peaks of the
mountains, the nebular mist arising seemed the cloud-folds of her
garments. And when I lay on my back at noon time, in the cedar grove,
gazing upward through the shivering green dome at the sky, I always
dreamed of the splendor of her eyes.

I grew to wonder how I should meet her. Someway, I always pictured
myself astride my good cayuse, Buttons, on the river road returning
from Roselake village, gay in my holiday clothes, with a freshly shaven
face, and a bag of peppermints in my pocket for Joey.

As it fell out I was in my shop by the river at work on a cedar chest.
I was garbed in a dark-blue flannel shirt and blue overalls, and needed
a hair-cut sadly. I heard a sound and looked up. She has come! I said
to myself. Out of the land of dreams she has come to me!

A young woman stood before me. The face I saw was oval and flawless.
The cheeks were a delicate pink. Her lips were vivid, her eyes luminous
as stars. Her silky, lustrous hair was bound with a broad band of blue
ribbon. Although her riding skirt was torn, her blouse soiled, although
she was dusty and disheveled, with shadows of weariness about her
splendid eyes, her manner was that of a young princess as she addressed
me.

This place is for sale, I understand?

I had not thought of selling the few acres that remained of the
hundred-and-sixty-acre homestead I had taken up eight years before; but
I was so overcome with awe and confusion, that I stammered forth:

Why, no--that is, I think not! I shall sell some time, I dare say.

Her face showed a flash of amusement and then grew thoughtful.

It is a desirable place, she murmured, half to herself.

I knew then she had come to the shop by the yew path--the path that
runs beneath the trailing yews and winds in and out like a purple-brown
ribbon near the spring, where the moss is downy and green, and the
bracken is high, and the breeze makes a sibilant sound in the rushes.
I straightened my shoulders, laid aside my plane, and rolled down my
sleeves. Thus far I had not fully appraised my visitor, having fallen a
prey to the creeping paralysis of shyness at my first glance, but now,
grown bolder, I stole a hardier look at her face. I saw the scarlet
lips, the brilliant eyes, and the ivory forehead beneath the midnight
hair. I saw the rose tint on her cheek, the tan on her tender throat
where the rolled-back collar left it bare. I saw--and I breathed: God
help me! deep in my heart; and there must have crept a warmth that was
disquieting into my gaze, for she lowered her eyes swiftly, and slid
her hand, in its riding glove, caressingly along the smooth surface of
the cedar chest between us.

What beautiful wood, she said softly. You are a carpenter--a
craftsman, she amended. How wonderful to work with wood like this.

Christ was a carpenter, a voice--a wee voice announced from behind
us. Joey had stolen into the shop through the rear window as was his
custom, and curled up on my work bench among the shavings.

Who told you, lad? I queried, being used to Joeys terse and
unexpected utterances.

My wonder woman looked at him sharply. Her black brows came together
as she surveyed him, and she did not smile. Joey stared and stared at
her, until I thought he never would have done, and she continued to
scrutinize him. I saw her eyes wander over his attire. Poor lad--his
collection of wearing apparel was motley enough--an old hunting coat of
mine that almost covered him, a pair of trousers unmistakably cut over,
a straw hat that was set down so far on his brown head that his ears
had perforce to bear the weight; a faded shirt, and scuffed out shoes.
But Joeys scrutiny was more persistent than the one accorded him, and
presently, my wonder woman was tricked into speech.

Well? she murmured, her lips relaxing.

Joey gave a great sigh, kicked up his heels like a fractious colt,
and rolled over among the shavings. Gracious Lord! was his comment,
delivered in awed tones.

Joey! I gasped, turning. But Joey was slipping, feet first, through
the window. I caught him by the trousers and gave him a surreptitious
shake, as I lowered him wriggling to the ground. He rolled over,
rose to his knees; his brown eyes, big and soft, looked up at me
affectionately; his lips parted in a grin of understanding.

Ill put the potatoes on, Mr. David, he vouchsafed, and vanished.

The beautiful face was questioning when I turned back. Mr. David, she
repeated. He is not your boy then?

I hesitated. No, I said slowly. Somehow, I was in no mood to tell her
Joeys story at that moment.

Joey has the manners of a young Indian, I apologized. I hope he did
not annoy you.

Children never annoy me, she replied.

A tiny dimple played at one corner of her mouth and died suddenly as
the half smile left her face. She bent her riding-whip between her
hands and a look of distress came into her eyes.

I am wrong, then, about this place being for sale? I saw a sign-board
back there on the road. It said For Sale in bold black letters. There
was a big hand that pointed this way.

A light broke in on me.

It must be Russells old ranch on Hidden Lake, I said. To be sure,
that is for sale. It has been for sale ever since I can remember.

I saw her eyes brighten.

There is a place I can buy, then? What is it like--this Hidden Lake?

It is a mere pond, hidden in the thickets. It can be reached from the
river. If you can find the lead you can pole in with a canoe. Its a
famous place for ducks. The tules almost fill it in summer. Theres a
good spring on the place, and I guess the soil is fair. One could raise
vegetables and berries.

I dont want to raise anything.

I fancied her lip curled.

No--no--why, I dare say not! How stupid of me, I murmured.

She flirted her whip impatiently.

Is there a road I can take?

I will show you, I replied, and she walked out of the shop as if
anxious to be off.

She paused in the cedar thicket beyond, and I joined her. We could see
the river shining like silver gauze through the green latticed walls of
the grove, and the sky above the steeples of the trees was amethyst and
gray. The sun was low in the west, and the shadows lay purple along the
wood aisles.

It was a magical May day. Hawthorn and serviceberry bushes waved snowy
arms along the river bank and dropped white petals in the stream, the
birch trees dangled long festoons of moss above the water, balm o
Gileads shed their pungent perfume abroad, and the honeysuckle and wild
clematis hung from the limbs of the slender young maples.

I held aside the underbrush for my wonder woman that she might pass,
and we went through the cedar thicket, threaded our way through aspens
and buck brush, and reached the trailing yews that were bending to dip
their shining prisms in the spring.

This is the yew path, I explained, breaking the silence that we had
maintained since leaving the shop. It winds through the meadow and
joins a trail that skirts Nigger Head mountain. Follow the trail, and
it will take you to Hidden Lake.

The soft neighing of a horse interrupted me. I peered through the
buck brush, and glimpsed a bay mare tethered to the meadow bars. My
companion gave a soft chirrup and pushed on before me. She had the
mares bridle in her hand, and was stroking the animals nose when I
reached her side.

I said, Allow me, and offered my hand for her foot. She glanced at my
hand, looked into my face, and smiled slowly as if amused. I felt the
hot blood mount to my brow, and then her foot pressed my palm, and she
was in the saddle, and her mare was wheeling.

Good Sonia, I heard her murmur, and saw her gauntleted hand steal
along the arching neck. She bent to me. The grace of her supple figure,
the vital alluring face, her baffling beautiful eyes, her ripe lips
with their dimpled corners, were sweet as life to me. For a moment our
eyes met. She said gratefully: Thank you. My ride will be splendid
beneath those whispering yews.

Of a sudden my hands grew cold, my tongue stiffened in my throat,
and my eyes smarted. She was going. I had no power to detain her, no
sophisticated words to cajole her. I stared after her, and saw her
ride away through the swaying meadow-grass to the yew path, the sun
dappling her blue riding skirt, and the breeze lifting and swaying her
bonny tresses.

When I went indoors after a retrospective half hour beside the spring,
I found Joey in the grip of intense excitement. The table in the front
room was laid for three, there was a roaring fire in the kitchen stove,
and Joeys face was crimson as he stood on a stool at the sink turning
the boiling water off a kettle of potatoes.

Ive made squatty biscuits like you showed me once, he volunteered in
a loud whisper, and stewed apples. And, Mr. David--Ive hung a clean
towel over the wash-bench, and scoured the basin with rushes.

I looked at Joey. Out in the woods I had undergone a savage battle with
my old self that had walked out of the shadows and confronted me. I
had remembered things--submerged, well-forgotten things; I had exhumed
skeletons from their charnel house--skeletons long buried; I had seen
faces I had no wish to see, heard voices, the music of whose tones I
could not sustain with equanimity; I had suffered. But as I looked
at Joey, the futile little friend who loved me, and saw his pitiful
efforts to please, the ice went out of my heart, and the fever out
of my brain. I turned aside to the window and stood looking out with
tightening throat.

Joey came and hovered near my elbow.

There are only two pieces of gingerbread, Mr. David. Ive put them on,
and you can just say you dont believe in giving children sweets.

I laid my arm across the lads shoulders. I looked down into the honest
brown eyes seeking mine for approval. The pressure of the two small
rough hands on my arm was comforting.

Youre a splendid provider, Joey, I cried. But you may eat your
gingerbread, my boy. There will be no guest. She has gone on to Hidden
Lake.

Joey looked aghast. His jaw dropped, and his eyes grew black with
disappointment.

And Ive sweetened the apple sauce with white sugar, and gone and
wasted all that butter in those biscuits!

I strolled into the front room and viewed the preparations. There was a
large bunch of lupine in the big blue bowl in the center of the table,
and all our best china was set forth in brave array. The bread-board I
had carved graced one end of the table; at the other, Joey had arranged
the two thick slabs of gingerbread on a pressed glass comport, a
paper napkin beneath. I was smiling as I stood there, but I had an
uncomfortable feeling that all was not well with Joey. A sound from the
kitchen attracted me. I went toward it. Joey leaned across the sink,
his face buried in the roller towel. His young shoulders were heaving.

I wanted her--oh, I wanted her to stay! he blubbered.

I knew not what to say to comfort my lad, and so I said nothing. I
caught up the pail and went outside to the spring for water.

I had filled my pail and was stooping to gather a handful of cress when
I heard the sharp click of wheels in the underbrush behind me. Some one
was driving over the uneven ground that lay between the cabin and the
workshop. I looked around. A girl sitting beneath a pink-lined, green
umbrella, in a two-wheeled cart, waved her whip at me. I straightened
up, dropped the cress, and ran through the buck brush after her.

Wait, wait, Wanza, I cried.

I heard her say: Whoa, Rosebud! And the buckskin pony she was driving
curveted and pawed the ground and set the green paper rosettes on its
harness bobbing coquettishly as she pulled it up.

Were you coming to the cabin, Wanza? I asked, as I reached the cart.

Whoa, Rosebud! No, I wasnt to-night, Mr. Dale--I was only taking a
short cut through your field.

[Illustration: I WAS ONLY TAKING A SHORT CUT]

She leaned out from beneath the shadow of her pink-lined umbrella and
smiled at me. Seldom it was that Wanza smiled at me like that. Friends
we were--friends of years standing--but Wanza was chary of her smiles
where I was concerned, and I must confess I found her frowns piquant
enough.

The day that passed without Wanza whistling from her peddlers cart at
my door seemed more cheerless than usual. Wanza peddled everything,
from shoe laces to linen dusters. She was the apple of her fathers
eye, the pride of the village, and the delight of the steamboat men
on the river. Ever since I had known her she had been her fathers
housekeeper. Her mother had died when Wanza was a baby. And she and her
father lived alone in a funny little house, flanked by a funny little
garden, on the edge of the village.

Wanza, I cried eagerly, come in to supper with Joey and me.

I looked up at her pleadingly. Her charming elf-face continued to
smile down at me. She shook her head slowly.

Please, I begged.

Gradually the smile left her face, a shrewd look replaced it.

I can make you a cake, she began hesitatingly, if youve got any
brown sugar in the cabin.

We dont want you to bake for us, Wanza--we have a good meal laid out,
and we want you to honor us by sharing it.

Glory! Is that it, Mr. David Dale? Well, Ill stay. Not, she added
quickly, that I wouldnt be too tickled to make you a cake, only--

Only--Wanza?

Only its great to be invited, with all the supper ready before hand
and waiting--it sure is!

You usually earn your supper with us, girl, I said, as we walked
toward the cabin. There is no one can bake such cakes as yours, and as
for your cherry pies--well, I have no words!

She tossed her head. And then catching sight of a long-tailed chat,
tumbling and rollicking above a hawthorn thicket, she stopped, her head
poised high, her delicate subtle chin lifted, her expression rapt. All
unconscious of my eyes she began making a funny little noise in her
throat:

Crr--crr--whrr--tr--tr--tr--

It was pure felicity to look at Wanza Lyttle as she stood thus. She
wore a gown of pink cotton, and her tangled maize-colored hair was
looped back from her face with a knot of vivid rose-pink ribbon. Her
wide-brimmed beribboned hat hung on her shoulders. Her collar was
rolled away from a throat of milk. Her sleeves were tucked up, exposing
brown, slender arms. Her feet were encased in white stockings and
sandals. She was a picturesque, daring figure. And her face!--it was
like a flame in a lamp of marble.

Her father, old Griffith Lyttle, was fond of dilating on the beauty
of his daughter to me. Once he said: She do be the prettiest young
gal astepping--but, man, I reckon shell see trouble with that face o
hers. Its the face as goes with a hot temper. Looking at her now it
was difficult to associate anything but loveliness of disposition with
her face, which seemed at this moment fairly angelic.

The chat has a variety of songs, Wanza, I ventured. He is laughing
at you. Unless you can caw like a crow, and mew like a cat, and bark
like a dog you cant attract him.

I like him because he is so bouncing and jolly, the girl answered. I
like bouncing, jolly people, Mr. Dale.

We walked on to the cabin. When we entered the kitchen and Joey saw us,
he gave a shout of joy.

Now, Id liever have Wanza to supper than the other woman, Mr. David,
he vouchsafed. I like the other woman, course I do, but I aint used
of her yet.

I refrained from meeting Wanzas eyes. I went to the stove and took the
biscuits from the oven with assiduous care. But when we were seated at
the table, Wanza in the post of honor at the head, she leaned across
the battered tea-things, rapped smartly on the table to attract my
attention and demanded:

What woman did Joey mean by the other woman, Mr. Dale?

I coughed. Why--er--only a strange lady who stopped at the workshop to
enquire if this place were for sale. She saw Russells old sign at the
crossroads, and, as she explained, thought the hand pointed to Cedar
Dale.

Wanza looked at me intently; an interesting gleam came into her big
eyes.

What sort of a looking person was she, Mr. Dale?

I reached out, helped myself to a biscuit, spread it with butter, and
answered with assumed nonchalance:

Oh--so so! She went on to Hidden Lake, following my directions.

Happening to glance across at Joey I surprised a peculiar expression on
his face. I saw astonishment written there and a look almost of chagrin
in his eyes.

Why, Mr. David, he burst forth, I been thinking sure she was our
wonder--

I saved the situation by springing from my seat and pointing out of
the window. Look, look, Wanza and Joey! There is a willow goldfinch
on that little spruce tree yonder. See his yellow body, his black
wings and tail! Isnt he very like a canary? I heard his song this
afternoon--I told you, did I not, lad? Hm!--he has the most charming
song--sweet as his disposition. And his flight is wonderfully
graceful!--the poetry of motion.

When we went back to our seats I was careful to steer the conversation
into safer channels.

That night at bed-time, Joey confidentially said to me:

I wont tell Wanza that the new woman is our wonder woman--cause she
mightnt like it. Anyhow, is she any more of a wonder woman than Wanza,
Mr. David?

It took me many months to answer that question satisfactorily to
myself.




CHAPTER II

HAIDEE


ONCE, years ago, when I was a lad, in an old volume of poems in my
fathers library I came across a steel engraving of a beautiful woman.
She had a small head with raven black tresses bound smoothly about
her brow with a fillet, but twisted back over her ears and ending in
ringlets over her shoulders. She had big dark eyes, a tiny mouth, a
slim white throat, and infinitesimally small hands and feet. Her name
was Haidee. I think her feet fascinated me most; for she wore shoes
unlike any I had ever seen, ending in high curving points at the toes.
She was a most distracting, elusive personality.

When my wonder woman placed her foot in my palm, and mounted her mare
at my meadow bars, to myself I muttered: Haidee. So, the following
morning, in answer to Joeys query: Whats her name, Mr. David? I
answered Haidee, and grinned at the lad sheepishly through the smoke
that arose from the griddle I was greasing with bacon rind.

Joey, giving the cake batter in the yellow pitcher furtive sly dabs
with the iron spoon when he thought me unaware, looked grave.

It dont sound nice. It sounds like that name you say sometimes--

Ssh!

When youre mad, finished Joey adroitly.

I shoved the stove lid into place beneath the hot griddle, and
motioned to Joey to bring the yellow pitcher. While I poured out the
foamy batter, Joey kept silence, watching the sizzling process with
fascinated eyes, but when I took the pancake-turner in hand and opened
the window to let the smoke escape, he spoke again:

Its bad for her, aint it, having a name like that?

It isnt her real name, Joey. Its a name I bestowed upon her. It
seemed to belong to her someway. We shall never see her again, so it
does not matter.

Well see her again, Mr. David, if she buys Russells old ranch.

I paused midway to the table, the cake-turner heaped with steaming
cakes in my hand. I stared at Joey. Curiously Id forgotten the
possibility of Haidee becoming my neighbor. My wrist trembled, the
cakes slipped to the floor. Joey pounced upon them, bore them to the
sink and rinsed them painstakingly in the pail of fresh spring water.

I like cold cakes, he was saying manfully, when I awoke to the
situation.

So does the collie. No, no, lad--we may not be living in affluence,
but we dont have to economize on corn cakes. I laughed boisterously
and patted his shoulder. My cedar chests are selling, and my book--my
nature story--is almost completed--why, soon we shall be turning up our
noses at flapjacks!

At flapjacks! Joey cried incredulously, making a dash for the yellow
pitcher.

We were half through breakfast before he spoke again, and then he
ventured tentatively: Suppose shell come to-day?

Who, Joey?

Her--the--woman. The one that made me swear when I saw her in the
workshop.

Oh, Id forgotten your behaviour in the shop, Joey! It was
reprehensible--it was rude--

Joey nodded. I forgot I was a human bein.

He put his elbows on the table, sunk his chin in his hands, and
regarded me. I raised my coffee-cup hurriedly, drained the contents,
and coughed spasmodically, Joeys eyes widening in concern.

Two days after this conversation with Joey, as, butterfly-net in hand,
I was crossing the ploughed field back of the cabin at noon returning
from a collecting trip, I saw the bent figure of a man approaching
along the river road. He carried a sack of flour on his back and he
walked with his head so far forward that his chin almost touched his
knees. I was feeling particularly jubilant, having taken four Electas,
six Zerenes and two specimens of Breuners Silver-spot, and I accosted
him lustily: Good day, Lundquist.

He attempted to straighten up, found the effort of no avail, and
nodded. I rested on the bars and he came slowly toward me. His red
face was so knotted and twisted that his very eyes seemed warped
askew beneath his ugly freckled forehead. His old hands were horny
and purple-veined, his legs spindling and bowed. Poor old derelict!
Hapless, hard old man! He lived high up on Nigger Head mountain alone
with the birds and squirrels. How he subsisted was a mystery. But he
always had tobacco to smoke, and a corn-cob pipe to smoke it in. This
fact comforted me, when I fell to musing on his meagre estate.

Its a fine day, Lundquist, I continued.

He came closer, halted, and peered up at me.

Ya, it ban.

Been to town?

Ya--I been to town. He took his old black pipe from his mouth and
crept closer. Last night, he stuttered, in his rasping broken accent,
last night I saw a light, Mr. Dale--a light--down thar.

He pointed with his pipe-stem over his shoulder.

A light? Do you mean you saw a light from your cabin?

Ya--in the old shack on Hidden Lake. He chuckled. Thar been no
light thar fer three year. The wood-rats they eat up the furniture ole
Russell leave. Place sold--maybe?

I saw Joey watching me miserably during dinner. I ate like an
automaton, and never once did I speak. Afterward it was no better.
I took my book and sat on a bench outside the cabin. Joeys voice
soaring high above the rattle of the dishes in the sink; a red-shafted
flicker hammering noisily on a pine tree before the door, saluting me
with his kee-yer, kee-yer; the whistle of the Georgie Oaks at the
draw-bridge, were all heard as in a dream. I was back in the workshop
with Haidee, I heard her eager question: There is a place I may buy,
then? I tried to picture to myself Russells old cabin metamorphosed
by that radiant presence. It required a daring stretch of the
imagination to vision anything so improbable.

The valley which lies like an emerald-green jewel in the very lap of
the mountains in this section of Idaho, is watered by innumerable
streams which it seems presumptuous to call rivers, and honeycombed
with tiny blue lakes, their entrance from the rivers so concealed by
tangles of birches and high green thickets and clumps of underbrush
that their existence is practically unknown, save to the settlers along
the adjacent rivers and to a few zealous sportsmen who make portages
from lake to lake, dragging their canoes across the intervening marshes
and of the Georgie Oaks likens the shadowy St. Joe and the equally
shadowy but more obscure Cur meadow-land. The tourist sitting on the
deck dAlene river to the Rhine, and bemoans the absence of storied
castles, never dreaming of the chain of jeweled lakes that lies just
beyond.

It was on the most cleverly hidden of these lakes that Russells cabin
stood. Years before I had paddled down the river and contrived to
find the lead. But the thickets were still deeper now, and I doubted
my ability to find the narrow aperture. Toward the middle of the
afternoon, therefore, I threw the saddle on Buttons, and rode away
beneath the fragrant yews, seeking the trail that skirted the mountain.

The day was fair, the sky a soft azure, and the wheat fields rippled
in a sultry breeze; but as I left the trail and descended through a
boscage of cedars and scrub pines, following the damp clay path to
Hidden Lake, I shivered in spite of the warmth of the day. And when I
rode through the rushes that grew as high as a mans head, and emerged
on the cozy grey beach, and gazed across the deep blue, unnatural
quiet of the water, I was weighted down by a weird depression. I
felt suddenly like a puny thing, shaken with the knowledge of my own
mutability. A bittern rose up from the tules, flapped its wings and
gave its honking note of desolation; a flock of terns on a piece of
driftwood emitted raucous cries. Russells cabin stood before me,
weather-beaten, warped, and unsightly; moss on the roof, bricks falling
from the chimney, the door steps rotted, the small porch sagging.

I slid off my cayuse and stood contemplating the ravages about me.
Not a sound came from the cabin. Presently, I gathered my courage
sufficiently to mount the steps and knock with the butt of my whip
on the slatternly door that stood ajar. I received no response. I
waited. The bittern in the tules gave its pumping call, pumper-lunk,
pumper-lunk, and the hollow rushes droned suddenly in the wind like
ghoulish piccolos. I pushed open the door without further ado and
looked within.

I saw a small room, dust-covered and cob-web frescoed. The floor was
littered with refuse, the fireplace held a bank of gray ashes, the
home-made furniture had fallen a prey to the savage onslaughts of
wood-rats. A damp and disagreeable odor permeated the air. Surely she
has not been here, I said to myself.

I stepped to a door at the further end of the room, turned the wobbly
knob, peered within, and shrank back, confounded at what I saw.

The light was streaming in through a window that had been recently
washed and polished until it shown, over a floor freshly scoured. A
small white-draped dressing table with all a womans dainty toilet
paraphernalia met my prying eyes; a small cot gleamed fresh and
spotless in a corner; and on every chair, and ranged on the floor
around the room, were canvases of various sizes with tantalizing
impressionistic bits of the outdoor world painted upon them, while
streaming from an open trunk and overflowing in sumptuous, foamy
sensuousness to the crude pine floor was the lingerie of a fastidious
woman.

I took myself out of the house post-haste, threw myself into my saddle,
and plunged away into the enveloping shadows of the cedar thicket. That
night I climbed up Nigger Head almost to old Lundquists very door. I
cast my eyes down in the direction of Hidden Lake. I saw a small red
light gleaming there. I lay down on a ledge of rock and watched the
light, watched it until toward midnight it disappeared, the wind came
up with a soughing sound, the tall pines creaked and swayed above my
head, and I walked down the mountain--the rain in my face.




CHAPTER III

I FELL SOME TREES


ALL night the rain pelted furiously against my window, and the wind
blew a hurricane, roaring in the pine trees, maundering in my chimney,
and rattling the loose casements. In the morning the rain had ceased.
The sky was massed with black clouds, but streaks of blue glimmered
here and there, and there was a glorious rainbow.

Oh, Mr. David, Joey shouted, hanging on my arm as I opened the front
door, the sky looks like a Bible picture! But I was thinking of
Haidee and wondering how she had borne the storm, alone on the shore
of that black melancholy lake, through all the devastating night. A
huge pine tree lay uprooted across the path, the serviceberry bushes
were stripped bare of bloom, and a cottonwood growing on the river bank
sprawled, a shattered giant, bathing its silver head in the water.

I evaded Joey, slipped around to the tool-shed, and taking my ax and
crosscut saw, mounted my cayuse and rode stealthily away. When I got
within sight of the cabin on Hidden Lake, I looked around me fearfully.
Smoke was coming from the chimney, and the cabin seemed unscathed. And
then I saw that one of the towering pine trees in the draw adjacent had
fallen, and in falling had barely grazed the lean-to. The cabin had
miraculously escaped.

I rode around to the rear of the cabin and knocked with my whip on the
closed door. A figure rose up suddenly out of the bracken by the spring
and came to my horses head. A figure in a crumpled red cape, with big
startled tired eyes, and pale cheeks.

I have come to cut down every tree that endangers the cabin, I
announced grimly.

She looked at me, brushed her disordered hair back from her eyes,
attempted to speak, and failing, dropped her head forward against the
horses neck and stood with face hidden.

I came as soon as I could, I continued, brooding above the wonderful
bent head with its heavy ringlets of hair.

A sound unintelligible answered me. I sat there awkwardly, scarcely
knowing what was expected of me. Presently she moved, looked up at
me, and smiled. Her purple-black eyes were dewy. Standing there in her
jaunty cape and short skirt, with her opulent hair unbound and sweeping
her shoulders, she might have been a timid schoolgirl; and suddenly I
lost my awe of her, though my admiration deepened.

Were you alone through all that brute of a storm?

Yes.

I got off my horse, and she took the bridle from my hand.

I shall have to get a woman to stay with me, she said slowly.

An elderly woman?

No! No! A young woman--a strapping country girl with boisterous
spirits, she protested, an odd husky catch in her voice.

I revolved this in my mind. Wanza Lyttle is the very one for you, I
declared jubilantly. Then I added uncertainly: That is, if she will
come.

And who is Wanza Lyttle?

Oh, Wanza is a wonderful girl, I answered, warming to my part. She
drives a peddlers cart. Ive no doubt she will call on you. There
never was such a peddlers cart as Wanzas, Ill give you my word. It
has a green umbrella with a pink lining, and two green wheels with
pink spokes, and Wanzas buckskin pony is never without a green paper
rosette for his harness--

Youre not telling me much about Wanza, after all, Haidee
interrupted, opening her velvet eyes wide, and favoring me with an odd
glance.

Oh, but I am, I am going on to tell you that Wanza lined the green
umbrella herself, and painted her cart. She is very capable. She makes
cherry pies that melt in your mouth. And her tatting!--you should see
her tatting.

Its on all her dresses, I suppose?

It is. And her dresses are pink and starchy. Yes, I ended, Wanza is
very capable, indeed-- I hesitated. It was awkward not knowing what to
call my wonder woman.

My name is Judith Batterly, she said quietly, seeing my
hesitation--Mrs. Batterly. I am a widow.

A turbulent tide of crimson swept up to her brow as she spoke. Her
eyes sought the ground. There was a silence. The sun had forsaken its
nest of feathery clouds and all the shy woodland things began to prink
and preen. A flycatcher ruffled its olive plumage on an old stump
in the spring, a blue jay jargoned stridently. Above our heads tiny
butterflies floated--an iridescent, turquoise cloud. A fragrant steam
arose from the damp earth.

As the sound of my trusty ax rang through the woods, and I chopped
and sawed with a will all through the morning, I asked myself what it
mattered to me whether Haidee were maid, wife or widow. I asked myself
this, over and over again, and I did not answer my own question.

By noon I was hot, streaming with perspiration, and covered with chips
and sawdust. I was inspecting a symmetrical, soaring white fir-tree
that towered some fifty feet distant from the cabin, when a voice
behind me cried: No, no! so peremptorily, that I started.

I turned to see Haidee standing there. She had looped up the masses of
her black hair, and discarded the scarlet cape for a white corduroy
jacket. A white duck skirt gave her an immaculate appearance.

I want that fir left, she explained.

Your cabin is in jeopardy while it stands, I assured her.

Oh, Ill take the risk, she said carelessly.

It is foolish to take a risk, I countered.

She smiled. Are all woodsmen as cautious as you?

Now, I am convinced she was only bantering me, but I chose to take
offense. I looked at her cool daintiness, and met her level gaze
with shifting sullen eyes. I was unpleasantly aware of the figure I
presented, with my grimy hands and soiled clothing, and red, streaming
face. I reached for my handkerchief, remembered that I had lent it to
Joey, and used the back of my hand, instead, to wipe my beaded forehead.

It is sometimes fortunate for the new-comer that we woodsmen are
before-handed, I said pointedly.

At this, a stain of carmine crept into the flawless face. Resentment
deepened in her eyes. Thank you for your mornings work, my man, she
said, as if to an inferior. How much do I owe you?

A vast slow anger shook me. I saw her through hot eyes. I did not
answer. She lifted her shoulders with a forebearing shrug, and tendered
me a coin on a palm that was like a pink rose petal. I snatched at the
coin. I sent it spinning into the buck brush. And I turned on my heel.

When you want that tree felled, send for old Lundquist back on Nigger
Head. Hes the man you want, I growled, jerking my thumb over my
shoulder.

By the time I reached Cedar Dale, I was overcome with chagrin and
remorse at my uncouth behavior. The more so, when on dismounting I
turned Buttons over to Joeys eager hands; for in the saddle-bag Joey
discovered a small flat parcel addressed: To the boy who goes to
Sunday School. The parcel contained peppermints of a kind Joey had
never encountered before, and a gaily striped Windsor tie between the
leaves of a book of rhymes.

Each night after that I climbed Nigger Head and lay on my ledge of
basaltic rock and watched the light down on Hidden Lake. Each time the
wind came up in the night, I turned uneasily on my pillow and thought
of Haidee alone in that ramshackle cabin. And I worried not a little
over that white fir that towered there, sentinel like, but menacing her
safety.

Joey surprised me one day with the information that he had been to
Hidden Lake.

I took Jingles--the collie. Jingles carried the basket, he added.

What basket? I asked sharply, looking up from the flute I was making
for Joey out of a bit of elder.

The basket with the strawberries.

I knew of course they were berries from my vines, that were unusually
flourishing for that season of the year, but I continued:

What strawberries, Joey?

Joeys honest eyes never wavered. He smiled at me, pursed his lips, and
attempted a whistle.

Im most sure I saw a little brown owl fly out of a hole in the ground
last night, Mr. David, he ventured, giving over the whistling after a
time. Do owls burrow in holes--like rabbits?

What strawberries, Joey? I repeated perseveringly.

Our strawberries--mine and yours. I put green salmon berry leaves in
the basket. Jingles carried it so careful! Never spilled a berry.

I stroked the shaggy head at my knee. Hes a good old fuss pup. Arent
you, Jingles?

Thats what she said, Mr. David. I sat on her porch a whole hour. She
asked the most questions. Joey reflected. People always ask boys
questions.

Do they, Joey?

Gracious--goodness! I should say so! She asked me what I was agoing to
be when I grow up. I told her-- Joey came over to my knee and stroked
the flute in my hand caressingly.

What did you tell her, boy?

I told her, he took his hand away and looked at me slyly, I told her
I was agoing to be a fixing man like you.




CHAPTER IV

WANZA


WANZA, I asked, how would you like to earn some money?

Wanzas big child eyes looked at me from beneath the curls that tumbled
distractingly about her fair face.

Mr. Dale, she said solemnly, I earn six dollars a week with my cart.

We were sitting on the river bank in the shade of some cottonwoods,
having met at the village post-office. We had met at three oclock,
and it was close onto five when I propounded my query. I admitted to
myself, when I put the question, that I had been philandering. But
there was not a swain in the village of Roselake who did not philander
with Wanza. And Wanza, gay, quick-tempered, happy-hearted Wanza--who
knew if she were as guileless as she seemed with her frank camaraderie?

To be sure you do, I answered her, lying back on the soft green turf
and lazily watching the skimming clouds high above the terre verte
steeples of the pines, to be sure you do. But how would you like to
earn thirty dollars a month--and still drive your cart?

Mr. Dale, Wanza returned, solemnly as before, it cant be done.

Her eyes had grown bigger and brighter, and she rocked forward,
clasping her hands over her knees. I did not reply to this assertion,
and after a pause she spoke one word, still hugging her knees and
keeping her cornflower blue eyes fixed steadily on the river. How?

Wanza, I asked, did you know Russells old ranch on Hidden Lake had
been sold?

She shook her head.

A lady has bought it. And this lady wants a companion--some one young
and lively. I think she would pay you well for being--er--lively. And I
am almost sure she would not object to the peddlers cart, if you would
give up your evenings to her--

Wanza spoke abruptly. No! Oh, no! No, indeed! she declared.

I was puzzled. Why, I said, I thought the plan a capital one.

But it isnt. Just think of it, Mr. Dale. Daddy at home alone every
evening, and me--all smugged up, asetting there on one side of the
kitchen table--her on the other--me asewing, and her aknitting and
asleeping in her chair. Oh, I think I have a large sized picture of
myself doing it.

Wanza, I began tactfully, how old do you think the lady is?

Wanzas lips drew down, and she shook her head.

She is not old, I ventured.

But I hate rich ladies when theyre middle-aged, Mr. Dale. A rich
woman, middle-aged, is as bad as a poor one when shes terrible,
squeezy old. The rich onell want tea and toast in bed, and a fire in
her bedroom.

Well, I said, I cant vouch for the ladys personal habits, but Im
quite certain she wont nod over her knitting, and I shouldnt call her
middle-aged, Wanza.

Wanza looked suddenly suspicious. Is she the lady as came to your
workshop, Mr. Dale?

Yes, Wanza.

How old would you say she was?

Not over twenty-six.

Twenty-six. A suspicious glint darkened Wanzas blue eyes. Pretty?

Yes.

The eyes glowered.

Thirty a month would be a help, now, Wanza, wouldnt it? I wheedled.

Wanza threw out both arms, dropped back on the grass and lay with
closed eyes. Presently she murmured faintly: Did you say thirty a
month?

I said thirty a month, I repeated firmly.

One eye opened. Wanza kicked a pine cone into the river, opened the
other eye, and stared at the tips of her copper-toed shoes fixedly.

Thirty a month added to twenty-four--Mm! I could go to school next
year, Mr. Dale.

You could.

I could learn how to talk.

How to talk correctly, I amended.

Thats what I meant. Well, it all depends.

On what, Wanza?

On her. If shes a certain kind, I cant go--if she isnt, I can.

It sounds simple, I decided.

We were silent for a time. I lay back with half closed eyes, watching
a king-bird that had a nest in a cottonwood tree on the bank hard by.
Presently Wanza spoke lazily:

Theres a lot of those Dotted Blue butterflies hovering about, Mr.
Dale--the gay little busy things--they look like flowers with wings.

I unclosed my eyes and looked at the azure cloud before us.

Those are the Acmon, girl. See the orange-red band on the hind wings.
Look closely. The Dotted Blue have a dusky purplish band.

Of course. I dont seem to learn very fast. But Im getting to know
the birds, and I do know heaps about the wild flowers. I never saw such
big daisies as I saw to-day in the meadow back of our house--I dont
suppose you call them daisies--and a yellow-throat has a nest among
em. Yes! Oh, the meadow looks like a snow field! I been watching the
daisies--they close up at night, tight.

And they open with the dawn. Daisies are not very common in the west.
I must have a look at your snow field.

Wanzas luxuriant hair of richest maize color was spread out in sheeny
wealth over the pillow of pine needles on which her head rested. I
reached out negligently and separated a long curl from its fellows.
How silky and fine it is, I commented. Wanza lay motionless. It
would be wonderful--washed, I murmured, half to myself.

Wanza kicked another pine cone into the river.

Plenty of soap and a thorough rinsing, I continued musingly.

Let it alone, Wanza commanded crossly, her light brows coming
together over stormy eyes.

I cant, I said teasingly. My fingers are rough, and it clings.

Wanza sat up quickly, cried Ouch! and the next instant I received a
stinging slap on the cheek. I caught her by the elbows, got to my feet,
and pulled her up beside me.

I think I wont recommend you to the lady who has bought Russells old
ranch, after all, I taunted. She wouldnt want a virago.

She gave a smothered sound and put her head down suddenly into the
crook of her arm, and I felt that she was weeping. I looked down at the
sunny hair straying in beautiful disarray over the rough sleeve of my
flannel shirt, and I experienced a pang of self-reproach. I had wounded
her pride. I had offended grievously. Repentantly I attempted to lift
the burrowing chin.

I was only teasing, silly, I was beginning.

Wanzas head came up with an abrupt jerk, and--she bit me--a nasty,
sharp little nip on my ingratiating finger.




CHAPTER V

THE LEAD


I SEEMED to have cut myself off quite effectually from communication
with either Haidee or Wanza. The days went by, colorless and unlovely.
And June came at last, bringing new wonderful wild flowers, and added
tassels to the tamaracks, and browner stalks to the elder bushes.

One unusually hot afternoon I sat in my canoe, idly drifting on the
shadowy river, marvelling at the clear cut reflections, and casting an
eye about for a certain elusive break in the screen of willow shoots
and rushes. If I once paddled my craft successfully through this meagre
opening, I knew I should find a narrow waterway that would convey me to
the shore of Hidden Lake.

What I should do when I reached that shore was a matter of conjecture.
But after paddling along close to the high grass and floundering about
in the tules for an hour, I gave over my search, rested on my paddle,
and fell into deep thought. And my thoughts were not pleasant ones.
Like the man in the story, I realized that at a certain hour of a
certain day I had been a fool.

A slight sound disturbed my reverie. I looked ahead. A canoe came
slipping along in the shade of the willows. As I stared and stared, a
voice hailed me, a voice compelling and shrill. Wanza sat, paddle in
hand, the thick fair hair pleached low on her brows and bound with a
crimson handkerchief, her young eyes disdainful, her lips sulky. When
she met my eyes she frowned.

I swept my canoe close to hers. Did you call me? I asked, with marked
respect.

She frowned still more deeply.

Wanza, I cried, with swift cajolery, washed or unwashed your hair is
wonderful. It is the color of corn silk, and your eyes are surely blue
as the cornflowers. Will you forgive my rudeness when last we met?

She smiled ever so slightly and the heaviness left her face.

How is business? I asked.

Ive sold one whisk broom, five spools of darning cotton, a pair of
cotton socks, and three strings of blue glass beads, to-day, she said
succinctly.

Glass beads are the mode, then? It is shocking how out of touch I am
with the world of fashion beyond Cedar Dale. I smiled across at the
flushed face. Now who among the ranchers wives, I wonder, could have
had the temerity to pay the price of three strings of blue glass beads.

Wanza drew her paddle from the water, giving her head a backward toss.
And it isnt to ranchers wives or town folks Ive been selling the
beads. Its to the gipsies at the gipsy encampment beyond the village.
Of a sudden her face crumpled with an expression of sly reflection. A
gipsy woman told my fortune too, Mr. Dale; oh, a great fortune she told
me!

What did she tell you, child? I asked, anxious to appear friendly and
interested. It must have been something exceptionally good, since you
are so vastly pleased.

Her light brows came together. She shook her head until her hair spun
out riotously like fine zigzag flames about her damask cheeks. It was
not a bit good. It was as bad as bad could be. Hm! It made me shiver,
Mr. Dale. She said she saw, Wanza lowered her voice and glanced
apprehensively over her shoulder at the tree shadows, she said she saw
blood on my hands.

In spite of myself I felt myself grow cold, sitting there with the warm
sun on my back. And I cried out angrily: Have you no better sense
than to listen to a pack of foolish lies from the tongue of a vagabond
gipsy? I am surprised at you, Wanza. Surprised--yes, and ashamed of
you!

I dipped my paddle into the water and swung my canoe about.

Wait, I heard a surprisingly meek voice entreat. I thought you was
going to get me a place with the lady as has bought Russells old
place. Have you forgotten, Mr. Dale?

I rested on my paddle. Oh, no, I said, airily, I have not forgotten!

I believe youve been hunting for the opening in the willows and
havent been able to find it, either! And here was I hoping you could
help me! I been looking for it for an hour. I was going to see this
woman at Hidden Lake, myself. After a while when I get to a slack time
with my peddling I may take the place with her.

There was a brief silence. I felt her searching eyes on my face.

To be sure, I said then, I can find the tricksy aperture that leads
to the narrow water route that runs between this river and Hidden
Lake--

Wanza interrupted me with an impish laugh.

It sounds like that nursery rhyme you say to Joey.

Yes, I went on with the air of weighing the matter, I can find the
opening very easily, I dare say, when I come to look for it.

Her eyes grew grave. She favored me with a ruminative glance. Presently
she said:

Well, go ahead--find the tricksy aperture! Im waiting.

I propelled my canoe forward. I shall find the open sesame, I boasted.

The gravity left her eyes; they grew starry with mirth. She repeated
gaily:

Go ahead!

After all it was through sheer good luck that I found the entrance to
the slight channel that led to the lake. Wanza gave me a surprised
glance as I held aside the willow shoots lest the branches rake her
head, as her canoe slipped through the leafy opening in the wall of
high growing greenery. My blood flowed smoothly and deliciously through
my veins as I answered her glance and swept my canoe along close to
hers, letting the willows swing into place behind us.

Oh, the secretive charm of the weaving, ribbon-like waterway, as
it glided in and out between the high willow-fringed banks of the
meadows! Oh, the flowered border-ways past which the curling stream
ran turbidly, oily and dark and shadow-flecked, beneath the shivering
grey-green tree arcade. Oh, the perfume of the syringa, the pipe of
mating birds, the bee droning that made the air sensuous with sound.
We were borne along silkenly. We scarcely spoke. We drifted thus for
a time, and then the channel, gradually widening, conveyed us through
leafy growths and over-arching green to the lake, snug in its frame of
cedars.

Ten minutes later I stood on the crumbling steps of the old cabin and
looked up at Wanza, where she stood, leaning against the door frame,
a waving curtain of woodbine casting delicate shadows on her face.
Glancing down and meeting my eyes she smiled.

Shall I knock? she whispered.

I nodded.

But her knock elicited no response.

I reckon shes gone off into the woods sketching. Old Lundquist says
she sketches a lot, and rides, and shoots at marks.

My heart sank. I sat down on the top step. Wanza seated herself on the
piazza railing. Quiet here, isnt it? she said musingly. I think
Id like living here. Its wild and free. Why, the village just seems
to cramp me sometimes! Whats that funny bird making that screeching
noise, Mr. Dale? And where is he?

In the pine tree yonder. High up on one of the topmost branches.
Thats our western wood pewee, Wanza. Listen and you will hear the true
pewee note. He gives it occasionally. But his customary note is a very
strident unlovely one, almost like the cry a hawk makes--there! He is
giving his pewee call, now.

We sat very still, listening. Pewee, Pewee, the bird gave its sad,
plaintive cry, repeatedly.

Presently I said: So even as unconventional a place as Roselake
village makes you restless, does it, Wanza?

I should say so. Its the people--and--and church!

Church!

She met my eyes somberly. Going to church almost kills me. It does,
honest. Hats do, too.

Hats!

Thinking about em. Seeing em on other people--in front of you--at
church--knowing they cant afford em--but wishing youd skimped Dad a
little more on his white sugar and got a better one.

I laughed outright. Her eyes continued to meet mine broodingly.

Why dont we have church outdoors, Mr. Dale? And why dont we just
kneel down in our work clothes, bareheaded? Id like to know! The
trouble with church is that we only have it once a week and in the
house. If we had it in the woods or fields and we didnt go dressed
up--oh, a bodyd feel so much nearer to heaven!

The woods were Gods first temples, I said gently.

Id like to go to church in the woods, and to school in the woods.
When I am sick--even sick-hearted--the out of doors seems to cure me,
Mr. Dale.

Nature is sanative, I agreed.

Her eyes fired. I love every tree and every shrub, and every rose and
every trillium--yes, even the weeds--yarrow aint so bad! Its got a
fine nutty flavor, hasnt it now? I love the scarred old mountains, and
I love the dew on fine mornings, and the sky on stormy nights.

Heavens terrible bonfires, and the delicate rainbow belt--the purple
of the new day, I murmured dreamily.

Wanza drew her feet up beneath her gown, and clasped her knees with her
hands. Looking across them she put a wistful question: Does it seem
long to you since you were a little boy, Mr. Dale?

Rather long, I answered drearily.

I feel still as if I was a little girl. Funny, aint it? I like such
wee things--flowers and birds, and kittens and puppies.

You seem very childlike, Wanza--your mind is like that of a child--I
mean--you think like a child. Here I broke off, catching an indignant
flash in her eye.

How do you know I think like a child? I may act like one. And a very
bad one, too, sometimes! I dont deny that. But my thoughts--well, they
are my own! Id be willing sometimes to have them child-thoughts. She
sighed ponderously. Hm! I have some pretty grown-up thoughts--and
worries, times, when Im all alone.

I intended to say, Wanza girl, that you have a young soul--students of
Oriental literature tell us that some souls are younger than others.

She looked at me, frowned, bit her lip and then said dryly: Do they
know more about it than we do?

I think so, child.

Oh, all right--I dont care! So long as I know Ive got a soul its
enough for me.

There are people--do you know it, little girl?--who doubt the
existence of the soul.

What?

Wanza turned on me so quickly that she almost lost her balance on the
piazza railing. I repeated my remark.

They dont believe--they dont belie--why, David Dale, how dare you
sit there and tell me such stuff as that!

I am speaking the truth, girl.

Did you ever know any one who thought that way? Tell me that?

Yes--one or two.

Where?

At college.

At college! Wanza gave a quick twitter of mirth. Well, if they
was such fools as that, why did they waste their time trying to learn
anything.

I shook my head. I cannot answer that, Wanza.

Why! Couldnt they smell the flowers, and see the birds--and hear em,
and look up at the stars at night?

I shook my head again. One would think so, child.

Perhaps they never looked down at the flowers, or up at the birds, or
higher up at the stars.

Perhaps not.

Law! Disgust was painted on her speaking face. I knew there was all
kinds of people in the world!--siwashs, and cannibals, and heathen as
never had a chance--but I never knew before that there was educated
white men who didnt believe folks has got souls. She uncramped her
knees, let her feet down until they touched the floor, and rose to her
full height, stretching her arms high over her head. Standing thus, she
raised her face and closed her eyes, I saw her lips move.

Still maintaining her position she whispered presently:

Even with my eyes shut--not being able to see anything--I can _feel_
God!

And this was Wanza--simple, ignorant Wanza! whom I aspired to teach.

We sat on the steps, side by side till sundown, waiting for the
mistress of the cabin to appear. But she did not come. And in the
twilight Wanza and I paddled back through the narrow lead, and parted
where it joins the river. Her song floated back to me as I swept along
in my canoe,--an old, old song I had often heard my father sing:

  Wait for me at heavens gate--Sweet Bell Mahone.

In the east I saw the thin curve of the new moon; the departing sun
had left the west purple and gold, the water was streaked with color.
I heard the whistle of the thrush, and the weird, Kildee-Kildee
of the Kildeer from the marshy shore of the lake. The hour was rich
with charm. Old Indian legends leaped to my mind as the fascinating
Kildee-Kildee note continued. I thought of myself as a little chap
listening to Leather Stocking bed-time tales told to me by my father,
while I lay watching with charmed eyes the shadow of the acacia tree
on the opposite wall. Memories stirred. My throat tightened. Before
I could grip my thoughts and turn them aside to safer channels, tears
rolled down my cheeks. Dad, Dad, I whispered, over and over, as if he
might hear me, anything for you--anything!




CHAPTER VI

CAPTAIN GRIF


WANZAS father had always been an interesting personality to me. He was
a portly, ponderous-speaking man, with a rubicund visage, a twinkling
eye, and a jovial smile. There was a humourous twist to each sentence
he turned, and this in connection with an undeniable stutter made
conversation with him an unending source of joy.

He had been a sea captain in his youth. He could spin me yarns by the
hour. And many a snug winter evening I had spent in the little room
under the eaves of his comfortable cottage, listening to tales of the
high seas, and songs of the rolling main. His room with its slanting
ceiling, its built-in bunks, its nautical equipment of compass and
sextant, charts and logbook and maps, smacked pleasantly of the sea;
and when the wind roared in the chimney and the snow and sleet twanged
on the window panes, I used to shut my eyes and fancy myself aboard
the good ship _Wanderer_ bound for the North Seas.

There was always a glass on the table, and a bottle of home-made root
beer was always forthcoming, and though I was not over fond of this
drink a glass of it had a grateful tang, when I drank with Old Grif
Lyttle, the captain of the bonny brig _Wanderer_, in the small cubby
hole he called his cabin.

The captain invariably wore a blue jacket with brass buttons. His
nether garments might be what one would call shabby and uncouth, but
the jacket was always neatly brushed, the buttons burnished. Wanza
was like the Hebe in Pinafore--she kept his buttons bright. And had
he owned a sword to polish I am well satisfied it would have been
immaculate. Wanzas pride in her father was unbounded. It was equaled
only by his pride in her.

The smartest gal--and the prettiest, he would say, youll f-find in
the whole state. Jest like her dead mother, Mr. Dale, jest like her.
Smart as a s-sand piper. Named herself--she did. Did I ever tell you
about that now? Here he would pause and look at me sharply. And though
the tale was a familiar one to me I would always affect deep interest
and bid him proceed. It was this a-way, he would continue, when her
mother was my sweetheart, being of a fanciful turn, and with a decided
hankerin after me,--as was to be expected, when I was gone for months
on the sea and everything uncertain like,--she called me her wanderer.
I was her wanderer, and her wandering boy, and finally her wandering
husband. So when I got my ship at last it was natural--although I was
in favor of naming the craft after her--for us to decide that the
name should be _The Wanderer_. In due time Wanza was born. Well, it
had been easy enough naming the ship, but there warnt no name good
enough for the babe! Let her alone, I used to say, shes a s-smart
child, shell name herself. And sure enough when she was old enough
to prattle she began calling herself Wanzer, from hearing her mother
and me speak of the craft, sir. I reckon sometimes hearing us call it
endearin titles she thought we was referrin to her babyship. At least
my wife she allowed as much. Howsoever, from Wanzer she got it changed
to Wanza, and my wife allowed that Wanza was a genteel enough name, so
we stuck by it.

The small, four-roomed cottage where Wanza and her father lived was
at the edge of the village. It stood on a slight rise of ground,
overlooking the lake. From the narrow front porch one could look
abroad and see fertile fields, stretches of smooth, glossy meadow-land,
and the craggy grey-blue mountains in the distance. In summer Grif
Lyttle could be found customarily on his porch. And it was here I
discovered him, when in my new restlessness I thought of him and
wondering how he fared, sought him out.

He made me welcome. His ruddy face broke into smiles at the sight of
me, and he rose from his rocker, and shoved me, with a playful poke in
the ribs, into the seat he had vacated, saying:

By golly, ship-mate, I thought youd passed me up for good and all.

He sat down in a red-cushioned Boston rocker opposite me. A small table
stood between us, and as he spoke he gave me a sly wink, and whisked
off a white cloth that covered a tray that reposed there. A bottle and
two glasses stood revealed, a plate of pretzels, and one of cheese
cakes.

My lunch, he explained. That is to say--our lunch, boy.

But you thought I had passed you by. The extra glass is not for the
likes of me. Come now--whom do I rob?

Its Father OShan from the Mission. Heres to him! Hes an hour
late, and the man who is an hour late had better not come at all.

Not if he comes for cakes and ale, I assented, biting into a cheese
cake with relish.

No--nor if he comes for nothing. Punctuality is my hobby. Yes, it be,
s-ship-mate. Theres twice the spice to an adventure if its pulled
off when it should be. Cool your heels fifteen minutes, or a half
hour, waiting for the party of the second part, and you dont give
a--ahem!--what becomes of the expedition. Yes, sir! the keen whet has
gone if you have to wait over long for the other fellow. That chap is
a borrowin--no! hes stealin your time. And I dont borrow--and I
dont like to lend--and you cant respect a thief. So there you are!
He looked at me, grinned mendaciously, and continued: The other fellow
gets the cream of the whole adventure. Hes probably takin a drink
with some other old crony while youre waitin.

But that doesnt apply in this case, I reminded him, calmly helping
myself to another of Wanzas delicious cheese cakes.

Not in this case. No, sir! Father OShans probably been held up by
some one with a long-winded yarn of how the poor wifes adyin of
consumption, and the kids of starvation. The Fathers hearts that
s-soft hed s-strip the coat from his back to give it to a beggar.

Yes, I said, I well know that. Wanza has told me as much.

Wanza knows she hasnt any better friends than Father OShan and
the sisters at the old Mission up De Smet way. The smiling face
lengthened, he filled his pipe from the tobacco jar at his elbow,
and tamped down the weed with a broad forefinger. Wanzas a high
strung girl, Mr. Dale, shes peppery, and shes headstrong, but Sister
Veronica can do almost anything with her, ay! since the time when
I brought her out to the river country with me, a poor, sick, wee,
motherless lass, pretty nigh sixteen years ago. Shes larned all she
knows of the sisters about cooking and sewing and the like.

And we know that is considerable, I said.

Shes quite some cook, I make no doubt. There aint much Wanza dont
know about a house.

How do you manage during Wanzas busy season when she is absent so
much in her cart? She seems to be a very busy saleswoman these days, I
remarked.

Well, the days are lonesome like. But shes hardly ever gone moren
a night or two at a time--the gal never neglects her old dad. Once
a week she tidies and bakes regular. I am used to bachin it too, it
seems natural to cook vittles, and sweep--jest like old times. I allow
its great. The most bothersome thing I have to do nowadays is tendin
the flowers. Wanzas got such a posy garden it sure gets to be a
nuisance some days when my joints be stiffer than common.

He chuckled and waved in the direction of the garden plot at the side
of the house. Not but what I take a pride in it myself, he added as
he caught my interested and not wholly unappreciative glance.

To glance at Wanzas garden was to receive a dizzying impression of
pink and white bloom, pranked round by shining smooth rocks of uniform
size and whiteness. The flash and dazzle of it struck blindingly on the
eyes. It was Wanza-like. I got up, descended the porch steps, and went
to the garden, the better to inspect its glamour and richness. Rows of
pink holly-hocks, clusters of sweet William, trellises of sweet peas,
fluffy red peonies, pink and white poppies bordering beds of tea roses
breathed of Wanza. And yet--the wild things at Cedar Dale pleased her
best, I knew.

Captain Lyttle seemed to be reading my thoughts, for he said
facetiously:

Its a fairly purty garden, to my notion, but there aint anything in
it as good as the swamp laurel and lupine at Cedar Dale, accordin to
Wanza. She dont hold by cultivated flowers no more, she says. Give
her the wood-flowers as grows wild and hides away, she says. And that
reminds me, Mr. Dale, I got that bird you give her at Christmas on my
hands, too. Poor old Dad, she says, will have him for company. Hes
mine, she says, hes mine. But, Dad, whats mine is yours. Meanin
Im to take care o him. He put his hand on my shoulder. Come along
in to Wanzas room and have a look at him.

I was getting new side lights on Wanzas character to-day. Even her
room was an elucidation. It was small, with a long narrow window on
the south side and a door that opened into the garden. The walls were
bright with gay sprigged paper, the bed was white as a snow heap,
the curtain at the window was spotless and looped with pink ribbon.
Wood-work and floor were painted green, also the wooden bed and small
dresser. There was a green tissue paper shade on the lamp on the
table; and green paper rosettes were wreathed around cheap prints
and fastened with gilt headed tacks to the walls. But in spite of its
tawdriness the room had a fragrance of lavender, a nicety that was
comforting. It was a little girls room. Indeed, I spied a fat-faced
wax doll in one corner seated on a balloon-like pink silk cushion; and
on a shelf with an impossible beaded lambrequin stood a Dresden-china
lamb and a wax cupid in a glass case.

The canarys cage hung in the window, clouded in folds of pink mosquito
bar. But the canary itself was on the limb of a flowering currant bush
outside the window. I chirruped to it, but it contented itself with
chirruping back, and I left it unmolested. As I looked around the room
again my eye was arrested by a snap-shot picture of Joey and myself
framed in bark and covered with the inevitable pink mosquito netting,
standing on a small table at the head of Wanzas bed. Above it on
the wall hung a Christmas card I had given Wanza, bearing Tiny Tims
message God bless us every one.

Grif Lyttle evinced considerable pride as he showed me the room. His
genial face beamed, and his eyes shone as he looked about him from the
green rosettes to the beaded lambrequin and back to me.

Snug little nest, eh? he hazarded. Meeting my appraising eye his face
twisted into an odd look of whimsical interrogation. Some girl--what?
Know any finer--ever see a prettier?

No, I answered.

Nowhere?

No.

Ever eat after a better cook?

Certainly I never have.

Ever expect to?

No.

He gave his booming laugh, and led the way to the porch.

Right-o, ship-mate! Have another glass now, and well drink to the
gals health, and finish the cheese cakes.

Passing along the main street of the village some two hours later, I
saw Father OShan, climbing out of a ramshackle gig at the door of
the post-office. I went up to him and placed my hand on his shoulder,
saying:

Good afternoon, Father OShan, I want to confess.

His fine, ascetic face turned round to me with a wave of quick sympathy
overspreading it; then when he saw who it was who had accosted him he
laughed, a musical, clear-timbred peal, good to hear.

I have eaten your cheese cakes, I vouchsafed.

He wrung my hand. Good! Captain Grif doesnt have much sympathy
with the delinquent. I fancy his comments were characteristic. A
shadow fell athwart his face. I was called to the bedside of a
sick man--a dying man--a homesteader. He is dying in poverty and
distress--alone--but for me, yonder in the mountains.

My mood veered suddenly. I know the man--if I can help,-- I began,
and stumbled on; In like straits I may find myself, some day.

I felt my shoulder pressed. No, David Dale. Not you! Will you walk
with me a way? he asked abruptly.

I turned with him and we left the dusty street, and took the road that
bordered the river. Already the sun was slipping behind the western
mountains, and the water ran rainbow colored, between its high,
shelving banks. Father OShan took off his hat and bared his head to
the breeze that was springing up.

A day for gods to stoop--ay, and men to soar, he quoted, favoring me
with his warm smile. Ive had a hard day, Dale, a hard day.

I think I have never seen so rare a face as his. Rugged and yet womanly
sensitive and fine. He was a man ten years my senior, I dare say, and
in his glance there was something gripping and compelling, something at
once stern and gentle, whimsical and austere.

A hard day--but youve been equal to it, Father OShan, I cried
impulsively. When the day comes that I am broken in health, and old
and friendless, I shall ask for no other physician, no truer companion,
no more sympathetic assuager of pain than you.

I grinned sheepishly as I spoke, but my companion answered earnestly:

You speak as if you expected always to remain in your small corner,
Dale. If I could prophesy I would say two years hence will not find you
here.

I shook my head, and we walked on in silence for awhile.

You may marry, he was beginning, but at the black cloud apparent on
my face he caught himself up, saying: I cant believe you have no
future ahead of you, man. He went on, gravely: Dale, I want to be
assured that you look upon me as a friend. We know each other rather
well, and I think we find each other congenial. We have had some rather
interesting arguments during our jovial evenings with Captain Grif. At
first I thought you were a genius. But I know you better now. I have
studied you. Youre normal, splendidly balanced, healthy, resistant.
Youre clever and plodding--youll make good. But you are not a genius.
I like you immensely. Certain things I have gathered from Wanza make
me feel that at times you need a friendly hand--that you are breasting
treacherous currents, even now. Come, Dale, Id be your friend.

He held out his hand, mine went out to meet it and we struck palms
warmly. I said then:

I have not been a black sheep. Its a shadow on my past that keeps
me here, of course. But the story is not my own--it must be kept
inviolate. But my present troubles and ambitions are for your ear--if
you will have them. Theres my sordid, pinching poverty--you know of
that--and--I am writing a book--

He caught his lip between his teeth; his eyes flashed at me; he
appraised me.

What sort of book?

A novel. A story with a strong nature atmosphere. Someway I feel it
will be a success.

Good! Success to you. Success to you--and Wanza.

Wanza! I cried, starting uncontrollably. What has she to do with it?
Wanza--that child? I finished smilingly.

A child, is she? He came to a halt in front of me. David Dale, be
careful in your dealings with that child. Forgive me--I asked you to
bear me company that I might say this to you. Be careful.

But I do not understand, I parried.

He said nothing more, meeting my eyes gravely and extending his hand.
And so we parted. And I went home and smiled to myself over his last
words as I reviewed them. No one so well as I knew what an incorrigible
child Wanza was. I thought of the wax doll on the pink silk cushion and
was convinced.

Father OShan was the first person to whom I had confided my ambition
concerning the novel I was engaged on. I had labored at it many
months. It was progressing satisfactorily to me. By autumn I hoped to
complete it. I had a fond hope that Christmas would find it sold to
the publishing firm in the East to whom I proposed to send it. If it
sold--if it sold!--my plan was to support myself and Joey by the sale
of my cedar chests and wood carvings until I could make good in the
world of literature.




CHAPTER VII

WANZA BAKES A CAKE


ONE sunny afternoon in the following week I again took my canoe and
slipped down the river to the small aperture in the willows. This time
I did not hesitate, but entered the lead boldly. And I was no sooner
afloat upon the green-fringed waterway than my temerity was rewarded. A
canoe appeared around a bend ahead of me, and in the craft sat Haidee
plying the paddle. She was almost a dazzling vision as she approached
me. She was in white, and the shadows were green all about her, and the
ribband snood on her head was blue, and blue flowers were heaped around
her feet. When she saw me she called out: Have you forgotten that you
were to send me Wanza Lyttle? and there was an amused light in her
brilliant eyes.

In my confusion I stammered and was unable to make a coherent reply,
and after a quick glance at my face, she exclaimed:

Never mind! I have seen her for myself.

You have seen her?

Yes. I rode into Roselake village this morning and enquired right
and left for Miss Lyttle. Every one smiled and said: Who? Wanza?
Then I met her in her cart on the river road. I knew her by the green
umbrella. Haidee paused and ruminated, wrinkling her brows. I know
why she lined her umbrella with pink.

Well, I cried, disregarding the seeming irrelevance, is she coming
to stay with you? Thats the main thing.

Shes asked for a week or so in which to consider. But--yes, I think
shes coming to stay with me.

I breathed a sigh of relief. Then thats settled.

She went on evenly: Now that you have found the waterway I hope, very
often, after I have secured the services of that distracting girl of
the green umbrella--when I am lonely--and you are lonely too--you will
take your canoe and seek us out. Not, she amended quickly, that I
mind my solitude. All my life I have hungered for the quiet places.
But I must confess I have an eerie feeling--at times--on moonless
nights--and sometimes just at twilight--and always when a coyote howls
in the night. Her bright face clouded, then she shrugged. Never mind!
We all have our haunted hours. In the daytime I am gloriously happy and
carefree. I take my mare and follow any casual, wee road I can find. I
sketch in the woods, and along the river. I tramp too, and climb the
hills. But Sonia, my mare, and I are good company. I have hired that
funny bent man who lives back on the mountain to take care of my mare
for me.

Lundquist? I asked, quickly.

Yes. He has been very neighborly, she replied, with a slight emphasis
on the pronoun. She smiled, meeting my eyes, and I said quickly: I
shall be only too happy to call on you and Wanza. I can understand how
one not accustomed to solitude would find the environs of Hidden Lake
depressing.

Her face grew thoughtful. I have been wondering lately what attracted
me so strongly to the place. It is a drab, unlikely spot, I know. The
lake is like a black tarn at night, the dense growth of cedars and
pines is repellant, at times. In the moonlight the trees stand up so
threatening and ghostly. And when the wind blows they wave gaunt,
bearded arms abroad as if warning the too venturesome wayfarer against
intruding here. I have roughhewn my life, Mr. Dale, but I must believe
some force beyond me is shaping it. I have been fascinated against my
better judgment by Hidden Lake! I had to pitch my tent here, for a
time! I had no choice.

It seemed a strange confession. All at once a question leaped to my
lips, and I spoke hurriedly:

I wish you would tell me something of yourself--where your home
is--your real home!

My real home?

I can picture you with surroundings better suited to you. Even I say
to myself, God grant that this be not my house and my homestead, but
decree it to be only the inn of my pain.

The quick carmine stained her cheeks. She lifted the blue flowers and
held them, plucking nervously at the petals. Then she looked up at
me, and uttered something like a little cry of scorn. Why, its a
painters paradise--in spite of the loneliness that abounds! Cant you
see that?

I can see that, of course, I answered.

And I am an artist. So you are answered. Years ago, with my father,
who had mining interests in this section, I spent one whole summer on
the Swiftwater, painting. Since then I have hungered to get back to
this adorable river country. I have always wanted a painting retreat in
this marvelous lake-jeweled meadow-land, where the mountains shift and
merge their colors, and the rivers have such cameo-like reflections.
No matter where I may wander, she went on with enthusiasm, I shall
always be glad of this place of inspiration to work in and dream in--I
dont look upon it as a permanent habitation, simply as a delightful
camp in the wilderness I love.

Paddling home I recalled Haidees enthusiasm with a smile. And then I
bethought me that she had not after all told me the slightest thing
concerning herself or any recent home.

Some two hours later as I bent over the stove in the kitchen, intent
on frying some thick slices of cornmeal mush for Joeys supper, I
heard the whir and grind of wheels and the creaking of harness through
the open window. I glanced out. A buckskin pony and two-wheeled cart
were skirting the ploughed field and approaching the cabin. I glimpsed
a familiar figure beneath the pink glow of the lining of the green
umbrella. When the buckskin pony was near enough for me to see the
green paper rosettes on its harness, I called out to Joey, who was
laying the table in the front room:

Put on another plate, lad. Wanza is coming.

Something was amiss with Joey. His face had displayed unmistakable
signs of perturbation during the day, and there was something
infinitely pathetic about the droop of his brown head, usually held so
gallantly. I had thought best to disregard his melancholy attitude,
knowing that bed-time would bring an unburdening of his heart. In
response to my announcement, he gave a fairly frenzied shriek of joy.

Good--ee! he shouted, with such a clatter of hob nails as he crossed
to the cupboard that I could picture in my mind the jig steps that
carried him thither. Theres a wee bit of molasses in the jug, he
called to me, I was saving it for taffy--you said I might. Ill just
put it on. And the spring is most full of cress, Mr. David,--Ill
scoot out and get a panful before she gets here.

He was off like a flash through the kitchen to the spring as Wanza
entered by the front door.

I went to meet her. I found her standing in the centre of the living
room. The door was open behind her, and her hair was like a pale silver
flame in the light. As I drew near to her I saw that her cheeks were
splashed with crimson, her eyes dark with some tempestuous stress of
feeling. There was something unfriendly in her bearing. But I held out
my hand and cried blithely:

You are just in time to have a bite of supper with us, Wanza. We heard
the rattle of your cart, and Joey has gone to the spring for cress.

She met my glance dourly. Her brows came together and she ignored my
outstretched hand.

Mr. David Dale, she said with great dignity, perhaps I am wrong, but
its my opinion youve forgotten what day it is.

I smiled into the sullen face. Oh, no, I said airily, I have not
forgotten! To-day is wash day--therefore Monday.

Yes, and whose birthday is it, Mr. Dale?

I stared at her.

Whose birthday, whose? Just his--his--as never had a birthday thats
known of! Except that you vowed he should keep a day for his own every
year, and named a day for him, which I thought you meant to keep sacred
as Christmas, most.

A light dawned on me. Some years before Wanza and I had decided that
Joey must keep one day each year as his birthday, and I had dedicated
the fifth of June to my little lad; planning to keep each fifth of
June as if it were indeed the anniversary of his birth, as it was
the anniversary of his coming to me. A week since I had bethought me
of this, yes, even yesterday I had remembered it. But to-day I had
visited a charmed spot, I had seen a radiant being, I had listened to a
seraphic voice--I had forgotten. I hung my head.

Wanza spoke again. The poor boy, she said, poor Joey! There was a
break in her accusing tones. I didnt think that youd be the one to
forget him, Mr. Dale.

Im ashamed of it, Wanza, I confessed. My heart turned heavy within
me. I felt a traitor to my trusting lad who would never in his most
opulent moment have forgotten me. I am heartily ashamed of it, I
repeated.

After an uncomfortable pause I ventured to raise my eyes from the
floor. I saw then that Wanzas arms were filled with mysterious weighty
looking bundles. As I would have taken them from her she shook her
head, then nodded in the direction of the kitchen.

Youve got a good fire going, I see. Lets get busy! Split up some
good dry wood. I want a hot oven in ten minutes. Ive brought raisins
and spices and brown sugar--Ill stir up a birthday cake. And as for
you-- she paused in her progress kitchenward to favor me with an
ominous frown--as for you, Mr. David Dale, dont let that boy know you
went and forgot his birthday or--or Ill never speak to you again.

She passed on to the kitchen and I seized the ax and betook myself to
the chopping block. I had just laid my hand on a piece of resinous wood
when I heard a joyous confused babble of tongues in the kitchen I had
quitted. Joey had entered by the front door and shouted Wanzas name
gleefully. And then I heard:

Bless your old heart! Have you a birthday kiss for Wanza? Well I am
late getting round this birthday--I usually come at noon, dont I,
Joey?--but better late than never! Its getting too hot to eat in the
middle of the day. We thought--Mr. Dale and me--that we would change
the doings this year. We didnt want you to imagine, Master Joey, that
we couldnt think up anything new for your celebration. We lowed
as how you were getting a big boy now, and would like more grown-up
doings.

Joey responded chivalrously:

Youre terrible good to me, Wanza. I like any doings, most. Ill
remember this birthday forever and ever, I know. Why, its been the
funniest birthday! Mr. David has been on the river most all afternoon.
I was most sure hed forgot what day it was. But soon as I heard your
cart, Wanza, I knew what it was--a surprise party! Like folks give
ministers. And that was why Mr. David would not let on. I guess not
many boys have spice cake on their birthday, and can help bake it, too.

I heard the sound of a kiss, and Wanza saying in a choked voice:

Theres a bit of store candy in that brown paper sack, Joey. My, the
heat of the oven smarts my eyes! See, Joey! You can stone the raisins
for me while I beat the eggs for the frosting.

Of course Mr. David wouldnt forget my birthday, I heard my loyal
lad resume as I stole forward to the door with my armful of wood, Im
bout the same as his boy, aint I, Wanza?

I swung open the door, and dropping my load of wood to the floor, cried
cheerily:

Heres the wood to cook the boys birthday supper, Wanza. Come and
give me a hug, Joey. I think youre old enough to have a few nickels to
spend, boy,--put your hand in my pocket, the pocket where we keep our
jack-knife. There! What do you find?

A dollar, shrieked Joey with bulging eyes.

Its yours, I said.

His eyes opened wide, gazed incredulously into mine; his face grew
white; and then tears gushed forth. And I thought--I thought youd
forgot my birthday, he sobbed.

Wanzas nose was pink when I turned to hold the oven door open for her.
But her eyes were friendly, and her full, exquisite lips were smiling.

Its going to be a perfectly grand cake, she breathed.

Joey had run whooping out of doors to bathe his face in the spring.
Emboldened by the girls smile I touched her smooth round cheek lightly.

Theres a tear here still, Wanza, I teased, though my voice was
somewhat husky. Youre Aprils lady--sunshine and shadow--tears and
laughter; but youre a good girl, Wanza, a fine staunch friend to Joey
and me. Dont hold my thoughtlessness of to-day against me, please.

She dashed the drop away. Her cornflower blue eyes blazed suddenly into
mine.

I most hated you a little while ago, Mr. David Dale, when I knew why
youd forgotten poor Joeys birthday-- she hesitated, then repeated
defiantly, when I knew why youd forgotten.

Now, I said, challenging her, I defy you to say why I forgot the
lads birthday.

And Ill tell you why. Because youre thinking so much about the woman
as has taken old Russells cabin you havent got time to remember other
folks. Old Lundquist says you watch her light o nights from Nigger
Head.

Lundquist is a meddlesome, prying old idiot, I cried angrily.

Seeing me aroused, Wanzas anger cooled. I dare say he is, she
admitted, as she stepped to the oven door. Why should you be taken
with a creature like her, I should like to know! Such a flabby,
white-faced, helpless moon-calf.

She laughed, shut the oven door, straightened her fine shoulders and
went to the window to cool her cheeks. I looked at her as she stood
there, I saw her smile and wave her hand to Joey, who was performing
sundry ablutions at the spring. She was wearing a collarless pink
cotton frock, spotless and fresh as water and starch and fastidious
ironing could make it; her face was as ardent as a flame, her eyes
glowed deep and impassioned, her lips were smooth as red rose petals.
Her mop of fine, blond curls was massed like a web of silk about her
colorful face. I looked at her with appreciation. But as I looked I
sighed. Hearing my sigh she gave me an odd glance, then crossed the
room and stood before me.

Mr. Dale, she said soberly, I am sorry I told you what old Lundquist
said. I allow youve a right to watch a light on Hidden Lake if youve
a mind to. Look ahere, do you want I should go and stay with her?

Why, I replied, I think it would be kind, Wanza.

She bit her lip, shot a keen glance at me, and said shortly:

Then Ill go, as soon as I have done my own house cleaning.

Youre a good girl, Wanza, I said again.

She turned from me, sniffing the air. That cakes about done, Ill
warrant. Call Joey, Mr. Dale, and Ill put the mush on the table, and
see to the icing.

Somehow the meal did not pass off with the degree of festivity I had
hoped for. Wanza watched me from under her thick lashes in a most
disconcerting manner as we chatted desultorily, and my little lad was
unusually silent. I felt that I had not atoned to Joey for the long,
arduous day through which he had passed, that its memory lay like a
shadow over the present gala hour. To lighten it in some measure I
ventured a proposal.

Joey, I said, speaking abruptly as a silence threatened to engulf us,
how would you like to go gipsying with me for a few days?

Gipsying, Joey repeated. His face was illumined as he caught my
eye and partially sensed my meaning. Does gipsying mean living in a
covered wagon, Mr. David, and cooking bacon on sticks over a camp fire?

I nodded. All that and more, Joey. It means wonderful things, lad. It
means faring forth into the greenwood in a caravan in the rosy dawn
of a summer day, finding the most alluring trail that leads to the
most secretive of trout streams, lounging in the shade of spreading
trees at noon time, eating a snack of bread and cheese, poring over a
treasured book for an hour while you drowse back half dreaming to all
the pleasant happenings of your youth. Then when its cooler faring
on again, till the sun begins to drop behind the mountains and hunger
seizes you by the throat--

I broke off, catching sight of Joeys rapt face. It was radiant and
eager and wistful all at once.

Mr. David, he said, pushing back his plate, lets go!

If you dont go after saying what youve just said-- Wanza shook her
head at me, and left her sentence unfinished.

I could not have found it in my heart to paint such a picture, Wanza
girl, I replied, had I not intended to give Joey the opportunity to
compare it with the reality. We will stretch the old tarpaulin over
the ranch wagon in the morning, stow away some bacon and cornmeal and
a frying pan, harness Buttons to the caravan, and go out into the
greenwood to tilt a lance with fortune.

I laughed as I spoke; but a weariness of spirit that I had been
struggling all the evening to combat lay heavily upon me. Well, would
it be for me, I said to myself, to get away from Cedar Dale for a few
days. I had felt an impelling hunger to see my wonder woman again;
I had been restless for days consumed with the hunger; now I had
seen her, and a new strange pain had been born to replace the former
craving. I was in worse stress than before.




CHAPTER VIII

GIPSYING


IT was into the sunshine of a cloudless June morning that Joey and I
fared in quest of adventure. Our caravan was well provisioned with
necessities, well equipped with cooking utensils, stocked liberally
with fishing tackle. And with a lively rattle and bang--we rolled out
on to the river road and wheeled away at a goodly pace. I held the
reins and Joey alternately piped on his flute and sang a lusty song
about a Quack with a feather on his back.

Despite the depression that obsessed me my spirits rose as we went
on, and by noon when we were well into the heart of the deep lush
woods beyond Roselake, I am sure Joey could have had no cause to
complain of the gravity of his companion. Surely there is balm for
wounded souls in the solitude of the greenwood. We found a spot where
bracken waved waist high, where moss was green-gold and flowers were
sprouting on rocks, where the very air was dreamful. I felt a sudden
electrification. My feet felt young and winged again; I lost all
desires, all hopes, all fears; I only realized that I was unweighted.
In this meeting with nature I was stripped and unhampered--unexpectedly
free from the dragging bondage of the past few days.

We were on the mountain side, and waters poured down into the valley
below us, waters that hinted of trout. Heights were to left and
right of us, the sky stretched azure-blue between, all about us were
sequestered nooks where singing brooks played in and out among the
green thickets.

Shall we camp here, Joey, I asked, marking the satisfaction on his
face.

Oh, Mr. David, I was most afraid to ask! Seems as if we hadnt gone
far enough. I should think gipsies would camp near trout streams,
though.

He was already lifting our cooking kit from the caravan, his small
brown face alert, his stout little hands trembling with their eagerness
to assist in the unloading. We gave an hour to making camp. I built a
fire between two flat stones, and Joey filled a kettle with water and
placed it over the blaze, while I put my trout rod together, chose a
fly carefully from my meagre home-made assortment and went to the
near-by stream.

I whipped the stream carefully for half an hour and succeeded in
landing a half dozen trout. They made a meal fit for a king. And
afterward Joey and I lay on the grass half dozing and watching a pair
of violet-green swallows that had a nest in a hole in a cottonwood tree
on the bank of the stream.

Dont they like bird houses? asked the small boy.

They do, I replied. They will welcome almost any tiny opening. They
will go through a hole in any gable or cornice. They are industrious
and painstaking; they have courage and patience. It is fine to have
courage and patience, Joey. I was almost asleep, but thought it well
to point a moral while I had his ear.

What can you do with those two things, Mr. David, dear?

Almost anything, lad. I thought of Santa Teresas book-mark:
Patient endurance attaineth to all things, and I clenched my hands
involuntarily, and sat up.

I see--its going to be a story!

I shook my head. Its warm for stories. Try to rest, Joey.

He lay back obediently, and a hand stole out and stroked my hand.

But, what, Mr. David--what can you do with courage and patience?

The question came again, and found me still unprepared.

What would you say, Joey?

Well, the clear, light tones ran on, if you have patience you can
make things--like cedar chests and tables and bird houses; you can fix
things too--same as you do, Mr. David. Fixing is harder than making, I
guess. Most anybody can make things--perhaps--I dont know for sure;
but everybody cant fix things, like you can.

I gripped the small hand hard.

What about courage, Joey?

Pooh! thats for fighting lions and--and coyotes. Every big man can
kill lions. Id liever fix boys toys.

I dozed after a time, and from a doze drifted into refreshing slumber.
I awoke to see silver shadows drawing in around me, overhead a half-lit
crescent moon, tender colors streaking the mountains. There was an
appetizing smell of cooking on the air, and casting my eyes about I
spied Joey very red-faced and stealthy, kneeling beside the camp fire,
holding a forked stick in his hand on which was impaled a generous
strip of sizzling bacon. I saw a pan of well-browned potatoes hard by,
and I rose on my elbow prepared to shout Grub-pile, after the fashion
of camp cooks, when I heard a strange, sibilant sound from a clump of
aspens on the other side of the stream.

I listened. Tinkle, tinkle went the stream; swish, swish whispered the
aspens and young maples; but surely that was a human voice droning a
curious, lazy chant. I fixed my eyes on the aspen thicket. Presently
there came a strange rustling, a vague movement beyond the leafy
screen. I waited. Soon a brown hand parted the branches, two bright
eyes peered through. As I rose to my feet a slight wiry figure in the
fantastic garb of a gipsy darted from the bushes, leaped the stream,
and sprang into the little clearing by the fire. I saw a brown face,
poppy red lips, and a pair of dancing eyes, shadowed by hair black as
midnight. I bent a sharp scrutiny upon the intruder as she stood there
in the uncertain light, but with a petulant movement she drew the
peaked scarlet cap she wore lower over her face, and wrapped the long
folds of her voluminous cape more closely about her.

Let the gipsy cook your bacon, she said in an odd throaty voice to
Joey.

Joey with big-eyed wonder relinquished the forked stick and dripping
bacon strip, and the gipsy tossed back her cape, freeing her arms,
and began a deft manipulation of the primitive implement, turning it
round and round, now plunging it almost into the heart of the fire,
now drawing it away and waving it just beyond the reach of the leaping
flames. When I drew near with the coffee pot in my hand, and essayed
another glance at her face, it was too dark for me to see her features
plainly. I had only a dizzying glimpse of wonderful liquid orbs, white
teeth and wreathed berry-red lips.

[Illustration: THE GYPSY TOSSED BACK HER CAPE]

When the meal was ready she ate ravenously, almost snatching at the
food with which Joey plied her. The light from the fire played over
her picturesque attire, shone in her eyes and danced on the tawdry
ornaments she wore. She had seated herself with her back against a
log; her cape had fallen away, disclosing a coarse white blouse and
short skirt of green; about her slim waist she wore a sash of red. In
her ears were hoops of gold; each time she tossed her head they danced
riotously; and with every movement of her brown arms the bracelets on
her wrists jangled. I glanced at her suspiciously from time to time.
But Joeys delight was beyond bounds. He was so frankly overjoyed at
the gipsys presence that once or twice he giggled outright when she
looked at him. I saw an answering flash in her eyes. Of speech she was
chary, and all my efforts to draw her into conversation were futile.

She made no attempt to assist Joey and me with the clearing away of
the remains of the repast, watching us from under sleepy lids without
changing her position against the log; but when we came back to the
fire after our work was finished, and I stretched out with a luxurious
yawn, she smiled at me and mumbled:

The poor gipsy girl can tell your fortune.

I dont believe youre a Romany, I said sharply, youre much too
good looking, and too clean.

She drew back, resentment in her bearing, and I made haste to placate
her by saying:

The fact is, I have had my fortune told so often by gipsies in the
vicinity of Roselake that there is no novelty in it.

She frowned, and I asked, trying to speak pleasantly, Where is your
encampment?

She pointed towards the West. There! Way off, she grunted.

We sat for a long while in silence. The darkness was like a glorious,
blurred, mist-hung web, closing in beyond the circle of light cast by
our camp fire. The crescent moon shone palely, but the stars were like
crimson fires in the nest of night. There was a smell of honey on the
wind, a pungency of pine, a mingling of mellow odors; and over all this
the cleanness of the woods that was like a tonic.

Joey yawned finally, his head fell over heavily against my arm, and I
said, Bed-time, Joey!

As for me, the gipsy muttered, rolling over with an indolent,
cat-like movement on the soft moss, I sleep here. This is a good bed.
You sleep in the wagon?

Yes, I replied.

Good! The encampment is far away. I will not go through the woods
to-night. Not me. She covered her face with her cape. I heard a
prodigious yawn. Good night, she said, in a muffled tone.

I stowed Joey away on a bed of hemlock boughs in the wagon, and after
I had satisfied myself that he slept, I returned to the fire. I knelt
beside the shrouded figure.

Wanza Lyttle, I said sternly, uncover your face and look at me.

She kicked out ruthlessly with both copper-toed shoes, wriggled angrily
beneath her cape, and then lay quiet.

Do you think, Wanza, you should have followed us in this shameless
fashion,--and in this disguise?

I dont see why I shouldnt, if I wanted to, a surly voice replied
from the folds of the cape.

You are always doing inconceivable, silly things, I went on. How did
you get here?

I followed you on horseback. Rosebud is tethered a ways back in the
woods.

What will your father say to this? What will the entire village say
when the busybodies learn of it?

Father isnt at home; hes at Harrison. As for the others,-- Wanza
sat up, and cast the cape from her--little I care for their talk.

I wish you cared more for public opinion, Wanza.

Public fiddlesticks, Wanza growled, crossly.

Suddenly she laughed with childlike navet, her eyes grew bright with
roguery.

You did not know me just at first, now did you? The black wig, and
staining my face and hands fooled you all right for awhile. Dont
I look like a gipsy? I did it to please Joey--partly--and partly
because--oh, Mr. Dale, I wanted to come with you! It sounded so
fine--what you said about the greenwood and the caravan. Do you hate me
for following?

What could I say?

I made her as comfortable as I could there on the soft moss, with a
couple of blankets, heaped fresh wood on the fire, and then I crawled
in beside Joey and lay pondering on this latest prank of madcap Wanza.
I saw the moon grow brighter and pass from my vision, I saw the stars
wheel down the sky towards the west, and dawn come up like a delicate
mincing lady, and then I slept.

Joey stood beside me when I awakened. He had a scarlet ribbon in his
hand.

The gipsys gone, Mr. David, he said. I found this hanging on an
elder bush.

I breathed a sigh of thankfulness.

So shes gone, I murmured, not venturing to meet his eyes.

She was a beautiful gipsy, he continued regretfully. Do you know,
Mr. David, I think she was almost--not quite--but almost as pretty as
Wanza. I guess there never was any one prettier than Wanza, cept-- he
hesitated.

Yes, Joey? Except?

Is the wonder woman prettier? He put the question wistfully.

Perhaps not--I do not know, Joey. Could I say in truth she was?
remembering the face I had seen in the firelight.

But that night after Joey was tucked away in the covered wagon the
gipsy came again. I raised my eyes from the fire to see her coming
through the long grass toward me. She came springing along, her bare
arms thrusting back the low hanging tree branches, her short skirt
swirling above her bare feet.

I went to meet her. Her manner was bashful, and her eyes were
imploring. And after I had greeted her she was tongue-tied.

Now that you are here, come to the fire, I said.

She shrank from me like a tristful child.

Come, I said. And tell me why you have come back.

I havent come back--exactly. I have been in the woods all day near
here.

Why have you done this?

I dont know.

She hung her head and looked up from under her curtain of hair.

I threw a fresh log on the fire and she seated herself. I stood looking
down at her half in anger, half in dismay.

Are you hungry? Have you eaten to-day? I asked.

I have all the food I need in the saddle bags.

I seated myself then, and as there seemed nothing more to say I was
silent. But I looked at her in deep perplexity from time to time. She
was flushed, and her eyes were burning. Her hair was tangled about her
neck and veiled her bosom. She faced me, wide-eyed and silent.

It was deeply dark in the hill-hollows by now, but the sky was a
lighter tone, and the stars seemed to burn more brightly than usual.
There was no faintest stirring of wind. The silence was intense, bated,
you could feel it, vibrating about you. The trees were heavy black
masses, shadowing us. I heard a coyote yelp away off on some distant
hill side, and the sound but made the ensuing silence more pronounced.

Presently Wanza spoke: I wish I was a real gipsy, she said. Her tone
was subdued, there was something softened and wistful in it. All day
long I have had the time Ive always wanted, to do nothing in. I waded
in the spring. I slept hours in the shade. I drank milk and ate bread.
I bought the milk at a ranch house way up on the side of the mountain.
Glory! It was great! I hadnt a single dish to wash. Its all right
when youre rich--everything is, I guess. But when youre squeezy poor
and uneducated and of no account, and youre housekeeper and peddler
and Lord knows what! You dont get no chance to have a good time. Now,
do you, Mr. David Dale?

Her words aroused me somewhat rudely from a reverie into which I had
drifted, so that I answered abstractedly: Perhaps not, girl.

Well, you dont. What chance do I get? She stared fixedly at the
fire. I have to work, work, work, when all the time I feel like
kicking up my heels like a colt in a pasture. There was a strained,
uneven quality in her tone that was foreign to it. I saw that she was
terribly in earnest.

A gipsys life isnt all play, Wanza. Its all right in poetry! And
its all right for a gipsy. But Wanza Lyttle is better off in her
peddlers cart.

Well, Id just like to try it for awhile!

I remembered a song I had heard in Spokane--at Davenports roof
garden--on a rare occasion when an artist chap who had spent some
weeks at my shack had insisted on putting me up for a day or two while
I visited the art shops in the city. It was a haunting thing, with
a flowing happy lilt. I had been unable to forget it, and without
thinking now, I sang it.

  Down the world with Marna!
  Thats the life for me!
  Wandering with the wandering wind
  Vagabond and unconfined!
  Roving with the roving rain
  Its unboundaried domain!
  Kith and kin of wander-kind
  Children of the sea!
  Petrels of the sea-drift!
  Swallows of the lea!
  Arabs of the whole wide girth
  Of the wind-encircled earth!
  In all climes we pitch our tents,
  Cronies of the elements
  With the secret lords of birth
  Intimate and free.

Go on, Wanza breathed tensely, as I paused.

Have you never heard it?

Never!

I sang lightly:

  Marna with the trees life
  In her veins astir!
  Marna of the aspen heart
  Where the sudden quivers start!
  Quick-responsive, subtle, wild!
  Artless as an artless child,
  Spite of all her reach of art!
  Oh, to roam with her!

Is there more? Wanza queried as I again paused.

Oh, yes! Its rather long. I bent forward and gave the fire a poke.
Thats about enough for one evening, isnt it?

No, no! I want to hear it all. Oh, go on, Mr. Dale, please!

  Marna with the winds will,
  Daughter of the sea!
  Marna of the quick disdain,
  Starting at the dream of stain!
  At a smile with love aglow,
  At a frown a statued woe,
  Standing pinnacled in pain
  Till a kiss sets free!

Wanza was very silent as I finished. I felt strangely silent, too, and
weighted with a slight melancholy. But the singing of the song had put
an end to Wanzas plaint. Her face had lost its peevish lines and grown
normal again. The fire burned low, a wind came up from the west and
blew the ashes in our faces, there was a weird groaning from the pine
trees. The quiet of the night had changed to unrest, overhead the sky
had grown darker, the stars brighter. We continued to sit side by side
in brooding quiet, until the fire had burnt its heart out, and the air
became more chill, and drowsiness began to tug at our eyelids.

I arose then. Light of my tent, I said with gay camaraderie, I will
bring the blankets from the wagon for you, and since you are to sleep
here you may as well stay and breakfast with Joey and me.

She looked up at me oddly, sitting cross-legged close to the fire, the
light spraying over her dusky carmined cheeks. Say the words of that
gipsy thing again, she urged.

I cant sing any more to-night, girl.

Dont sing--say the words.

The evening had been so frictionless, that I made haste to comply with
this very modest demand; but when I came to the last verse I stumbled,
and in spite of myself my voice softened and fired at the witchery of
the words:

  Marna with the winds will,
  Daughter of the sea!
  Marna of the quick disdain,
  Starting at the dream of stain!
  At a smile with love aglow,
  At a frown a statued woe,
  Standing pinnacled in pain
  Till a kiss sets free!

Wanza rose and came close to me as I finished. Her black elf-locks
brushed my shoulder. If I was a gipsy and you was a gipsy, she
whispered, things would be different.

I saw her eyes. Some of the tenderness of the last few lines of the
song was in my voice as I whispered back, How different, child?

I stood looking down at her, and her eyes--burningly blue--sank into
mine. The wind tossed her hair out. A strand brushed my lips. She
seemed an unknown alien maid, in her disguise, and in the shifting pink
light from the low burning fire. I took a bit of her hair in my hand
and I looked into her face curiously. I stood thus for a long moment,
catching my breath fiercely, staring, staring--her hands held mine, her
scarf of red silk whipped my throat--how strangely beautiful her face,
the full lids, the subtle chin, the delicate yet warm lips! Had I ever
seen as beautiful a girl-face? The soft wind swept past us sweet with
balm o Gilead; the brook was awake and singing to the rushes; but
the birds were asleep, and a sweet solitude was ours. This girl was of
my world, all gipsy she, wilder than most. And I--was I not as wide a
wanderer as any gipsy? as homeless? I smiled into the eyes that smiled
into mine, and I hummed below my breath:

  Standing pinnacled in pain
  Till a kiss sets free!

Yes, the face of this girl was a marvelous thing, a perfect bit of
chiselling. Brow, cheeks, nose, chin, shell-like ears--exquisitely
modelled. Had I ever looked at her before? What rare perfection there
was in her face. And her nature was rich--rich! Her soul--

Ah, her soul!

Suddenly it was Wanza, my comrade, Joeys staunch friend and playmate,
into whose eyes I looked. The gipsy was gone. The glamour was gone.
Enchantment and madness were gone. I stood by a dying fire in a
wind-stirred forest, with the roughened hands of a country wench in
mine. But though she was only a country wench I admired and respected
her. And when she whispered again as I moved away from the touch of
her hands: Things would be different if we was gipsies, I replied:
Perhaps so, Wanza. But we are not gipsies. So let us not even play at
gipsying.

I went to the wagon for the baskets.

The next morning the gipsy was gone, and that was the last I saw of
her.




CHAPTER IX

THE BIG MAN


SOME two weeks later Joey informed me that he could play Bell Brandon
on his flute. I doubt if any one familiar with the piece would have
recognized it as rendered by Joey on the futile instrument I had
carved. The air being unfamiliar to me I asked him where he had picked
it up.

Oh, he said carelessly, she plays it on her guitar.

I was growing accustomed to the sight of Joey, followed by the collie,
marching sturdily away down the yew path each day as soon as the dinner
dishes were done, and I had more than once remonstrated with him on the
frequency of his visits to Hidden Lake. His answer was invariably the
same. She says, Come again, every time, Mr. David.

Thats only a way people have of being polite, I protested at last,
and was surprised to see the hurt tears in his eyes.

That night he came home radiant.

She doesnt say Come again to be polite, he announced, throwing
his cap in a corner and speaking blusteringly. She didnt ask Mr.
Lundquist to come again. She only said, When I need you again Ill let
you know.

The perfect weather changed about this time, and sultry nights,
alternating with days like hot coals, ensued, until, suddenly, one
evening at dusk, the wind came up with a roar, and scurrying leaves
and particles of dust filled the air. The dust storm enveloped us. It
sang and poured and hissed up and down the river, the temperature kept
dropping lower and lower, rain and hail descended, and the wind grew
more tempestuous as darkness came on.

As I pored over a volume of Tacitus that evening, glowing with the
sense of well being that the warmth of the fire and the cheer of the
light cast by my green-shaded light imparted in contrast to the storm
without, there came a vigorous knocking at the cabin door.

Joey, dozing on his stool before the fire, sat upright with a start,
and the collie growled and ruffled his back. A curious prescience of
disaster assailed me with that knock; a grim finger seemed laid on my
heart-strings--I seemed to feel the touch of a cold iron hand arresting
me on a well-ordered, dearly familiar path.

Joey sprang to the door, opened it wide, and a gust of wind tore it
from his hand. The rain swept into the cabin, and a man carrying a
suitcase came quickly forward from the darkness beyond, crossed the
threshold, and stood in the glare of the firelight.

He was a tall man, powerfully built, but he walked with a slovenly
gait, and something pompous and hard and withal insincere rang in his
tones as he set down his suitcase and spoke:

Pardon my intrusion, my man. Your light attracted me. Its blacker
than Egypt outside, and Ive lost my way in the storm.

He rolled back the collar of his slicker coat and shook the raindrops
from the brim of his hat.

Take off your coat, I said hospitably, and come up to the fire.

He thanked me, favored me with a patronizing glance from his
full-lidded light eyes, and stood rocking back and forth on the
bearskin rug before the fire, rubbing his hands.

I shall have to hurry on to Roselake if I am to get there to-night.
Perhaps you will show me the trail, my man.

I assured him that I would direct him, then realizing that the man
was chilled through, I threw a fresh log on the fire, and going to a
cupboard in the chimney-corner, took down a bottle and a small glass
and placed them on the table.

Have a drink, I said, it will save you from a bad cold on a night
like this.

Thanks. Dont mind if I do. He filled his glass, and as he did so
his glance fell on the book I had been reading. His manner changed.
Tacitus! Rather grim reading for a wild night like this. He turned
a page unsteadily, and followed a line with his finger. Mm! Nero, the
fiddler--its ghastly reading--bestial, rather. Cramming for anything?

No, I replied.

Take something lighter--Abbe Constantine, Hyperion, The Snow
Man.

His voice was thick; and as he stood resting his hand on a chair back,
he lurched slightly.

Sit down, I said.

He sank into the armchair and raised his glass, waving it in my
direction, then he rose to his feet, bowed, and said: Your health,
sir, and drank thirstily. I saw then that he had been imbibing more
than was good for him, but I could also see that he was literally
sodden with fatigue, and something impelled me to offer him food.

Now thats kind--very kind, he said throatily. I could not think--
He reeled back against the chair and put his hand to his head suddenly.

I signaled to Joey, who left the room, and I went to the man and eased
him into the depth of the chair.

Rest here awhile and have something hot to eat, I suggested.

His head sank on his chest, his lids dropped over his prominent eyes.
Yes--Abbe Constantine--or Hyperion--Hyperion, preferably, he
mumbled. Weak, disgusting fool--Nero!

He roused sufficiently to eat a few mouthfuls when Joey and I served
him royally with good corned-beef and hominy, and a steaming pot of
coffee. But he sank again into lethargy, and I saw that he was in no
condition to push on to Roselake in the storm.

I told him so frankly, and pointed to a built-in bunk covered with
hemlock boughs in the corner. Turn in here, I said, giving him a
couple of blankets. Ill bunk with the lad to-night.

I had taken great pains with Joeys room, and the narrow cedar strips
with which I had paneled it shone with a silver lustre in the light
of the two candles Joey insisted on lighting in my honor. Joeys bed
was a boxed-in affair, but I had contrived to make it comfortable by
stretching stout bed-cord from the head to the foot and interlacing it
across from side to side. This served in lieu of springs. The mattress
was a crude one of straw, but the straw was sweet and clean, and Wanza
had pieced a wonderful bed quilt of shawl-flower pattern calico, and
presented it to Joey the year before when he had the measles. The bed
had a valance of blue burlap, and I had painstakingly stenciled it with
birds and beasts and funny fat clowns and acrobatic ladies in short
skirts and tights, after a never-to-be-forgotten circus-day parade Joey
had witnessed in the village.

There was a gaily striped Indian blanket for covering, and pillows
stuffed with the feathers of many a mallard slaughtered in the marshes.
I had converted a couple of barrels into chairs and covered them with
tea matting. For floor covering there were the skin of a mountain lion
that had prowled too close to my cabin one night, and the skins of a
couple of coyotes that had ventured within shooting distance.

In one of the windows hung the wooden cage I had made for Joeys
magpie. But the windows themselves were my chief pride. I had procured
them from an old house-boat that had been abandoned by a party of
fishermen, and had drifted down the river to anchor itself before my
workshop. There were four of these windows, with tiny mullioned panes,
and I had hung them, two on either side of a door that opened out on
a rustic pergola I had erected. The pergola led to a bosky dell of
green--a veritable bower--where wild honeysuckle hung its bells in the
sweet syringa bushes, and wild forget-me-not and violets and kinnikinic
gemmed the emerald banks of a limpid pool so hedged in by high green
thickets that no eye save the initiated ever rested on its crystal
clarity. We called this spot the Dingle Dell, and the Dingle was a rare
retreat for Joey on the occasion of any embarrassing caller.

As I blew out the candles that night and lay down beside the little
lad, he murmured sleepily: Bell Brandon aint so terrible hard to
play on the flute--but its terrible hard on a guitar; a guitar makes
blisters on your fingers.

He spoke again almost unintelligibly. I dont like that man. He never
spoke to me once, Mr. David. Any one, most, speaks to a boy.

In the middle of the night I awakened. Joey was sitting up in bed.

A stars out, Mr. David. Im making a wish, he whispered.

Well, well, I yawned drowsily, lie down--youll take cold.

He cuddled obediently beneath the blankets. Im wishing the big man
would go, but Im wishing youd sleep with me just the same, Mr. David.
I sleep tighter when the coyotes holler.




CHAPTER X

JINGLES BRINGS A MESSAGE


JOEY did not get his wish concerning the departure of the big man, for
the next morning the big man was in no condition to go anywhere. He
was still lying in his bunk when I went through the room to build the
kitchen fire; and when breakfast was ready, he had not roused even to
the strains of Bell Brandon played on Joeys flute.

I stood over him, and he looked up at me with lack-lustre eyes,
attempted to rise and rolled back on his pillow like a log.

Morning, stranger, he muttered. He winked at me slyly. His face was
puffy and red, his eyes swollen, his breathing irregular and labored.
Whats matter? he protested thickly, then he smiled, with a painful
contortion of his fever-seared lips, I seem to be _hors de combat_.
Terrible pain here. He touched his chest.

Ill get a doctor at once, I said.

He thanked me, gave me a keen look, and asked wheezingly: Not
married? No wife about?

I shook my head. Unfortunately, no.

He winked at me a second time. _Lascia la moglie e tienti donzello_,
he cackled.

I went from the room pondering on the strange personality of this man,
who was unquestionably a scholar, and who, no doubt, considered himself
a gentleman. I dispatched Joey for a doctor.

Take Buttons and ride to Roselake as fast as you can, I bade him.
Wheres the collie? He may go along.

Joey, basking in the sun on the back steps, laid aside his flute. His
lips drew down, and his eyes bulged widely.

The big mans going to stay, then, Mr. David?

Run along, I said sharply.

As I let down the meadow bars, Joey turned in his saddle and gave his
clear boyish whistle. But no Jingles answered the call, and a moment
later the lad rode away with a clouded face.

A few moments later, as I plied my ax at the rear of the cabin, the
cold muzzle of the collie was thrust against my hand. I stooped to
caress him, and as he leaped up to greet me, I smiled as my eyes
caught the color and the sheen of a silken ribbon threaded through
his collar. Well, I knew that bit of adornment--that azure fillet that
Haidee had worn in her hair.

I touched the inanimate thing with tender fingers, and started suddenly
to find a jeweled pendant hanging there, glowing like a dewdrop
against the dogs soft fur. I stood agape, feeling my face soften as
my fingers stroked the bauble; and then I straightened up with a swift
presentiment. It was in no playful mood that Haidee had placed that
costly gewgaw about the collies neck.

I turned toward the stable, and then remembered that Joey had taken the
horse. My only recourse was the canoe. I ran to the willows where the
craft was secreted. I had it afloat in a twinkling, and was paddling
away down the river, the collie barking furiously on the shore.

Poor pale, beautiful Haidee! She lay like a crumpled white rose in
the bracken beside the spring. The white fir-tree that, in falling,
had crushed the lean-to of the frail cabin had swept her beneath its
branches as she bent for water at the spring. This was the story I read
for myself as I bent above my prostrate girl. But it was many days
before I learned the whole truth. How, close onto midnight, she had
heard a man hallooing from the lake shore; how she had stolen out from
the cabin in the storm, fearing an intrusion from some drunken reveler
from the village tavern; how, after the tree had fallen and pinned her
fast with its cruel branches, she had lain unconscious until with the
first streak of light she had felt the touch of the collies muzzle
against her face; how she had roused, and, her hands being free, had
torn the ribbon from her hair and bound it about the collies neck,
and, as an afterthought, attached the pendant from her throat, thinking
the ribbon alone might not occasion surprise.

She told me all this, days afterward; but when I reached her side, she
was incapable of speech, and only a flutter of her white lids denoted
that she was conscious.

I had a bad half hour alone there in the bracken, watching her face
grow grayer and grayer as I worked to dislodge the branches that were
pinning her down. And, at last, as I lifted her in my arms, I saw the
last particle of color drain from her lips, and realized that she had
fainted. But I had her in my arms, and her heart was beating faintly.
And, someway, hope leaped up and I felt courageous and strong, as I
bore her to the river and placed her in the canoe.

Joey was kneeling among the willows with his arms clasping Jingles as I
beached my canoe near the workshop.

I knew something had happened to Bell Brandon, he declared, in
big-eyed misery. I knew it! I knew it! He took the crumpled bit of
ribbon from the dogs neck with hands that trembled, and came forward
slowly. I was unprepared for the look of abject misery on his small
face. Oh, Mr. David, he quavered, dont tell me she is dead!

No, no, lad, I said hastily, she has only fainted.

He looked at me uncertainly, tried to smile, and a tear dropped on the
ribbon in his hands. Then a look of joy made his face luminous. The
doctors here, Mr. David. I didnt know I was abringing him for Bell
Brandon. I thought it was just for the big man.

So Joey had a name for my wonder woman, too. I could not but feel that
his name was the sweeter of the two.

I bore Haidee through the room where the doctor was in attendance
on the big man, who was by this time raving and incoherent in his
delirium, passed swiftly through the small hallway that separated the
cedar room from the main one, and laid Haidee on Joeys bed. Then I
brought the doctor. I left Haidee in his hands, and Joey and I passed
outside to the Dingle, and stood there silently, side by side, by the
pool.

I saw the green mirror flecked with the white petals of the syringa,
and I heard a squirrel chattering in the hemlock above my head, and
was conscious of a calliope humming-bird that pecked at the wool of my
sweater. But my whole soul was in that cedar room, where Haidee lay
white and suffering, and I was repeating a prayer that had been on my
mothers lips often when I was a child as she had bent over me in my
small bed:

Oh, Lord, keep my dear one! Deliver us from murder and from sudden
death--Good Lord, deliver us!

But Haidees condition was not serious. The doctor came out to us, Joey
and me, with the assurance, and at once the world began to wag evenly
with me. All she needs now is rest, he said suavely. She will now
be able to rest for some time. Youd better get a woman here, Dale, to
help out. Mrs. Batterly mentioned it. Therell have to be a trained
nurse for the man.

In the workshop Joey and I considered the situation in all its phases,
and Joey sagely counseled: Send for Wanza.

The suggestion seemed a wise one, so I penned a careful note, and Joey
rode away to the village for the second time that day.

In my note I said:

  _Dear Wanza_:

  I am in trouble. Mrs. Batterly has met with an accident, and is here
  at my cabin, unable to be moved. I have also a very sick man--a
  stranger--on my hands. Joey and I need you--will you come?

                                                  Your old friend,
                                                            DAVID DALE.

Wanza responded gallantly to my call for aid. In a couple of hours I
heard the rattle of her cart and the jingle of harness, and the sound
of Buttons hoof-beats on the river road, and emerged from my workshop
to greet her.

She stepped down from the shelter of the pink-lined umbrella, and
answered my greeting with great circumspection. I lifted down her bag
and a big bundle, Joey carried her sweater and a white-covered basket,
and together we escorted her to the cabin and made an imposing entrance.

The big man, tossing about in his bunk in the front room, ceased his
confused mutterings as we crossed the threshold, struggled up to his
elbow, stared, and pointed his finger at Wanza. _La beaut sans vertu
est une fleur sans parfum_, he said indistinctly.

Wanza stared back at him, ignorant of the import of his words; and as
I frowned at him, he threw up both hands and drifted into dribbling
incoherence. I pointed to the door at the end of the room, and Wanza
went to it swiftly, opened it quietly, and passed through to Haidee.

When I went to the kitchen, after giving the big man a spoonful of the
medicine the doctor had left, I found Joey on the floor, with his arms
about the collies neck.

I can trust you, he was saying, I can trust those eyes, those
marble-est eyes! Why, if it hadnt been for you, Jingles, Bell Brandon
could never a let Mr. David know.

The stage stopped at Cedar Dale late that afternoon, and set down the
trained nurse. And our curious mnage was complete.

The nurse proved to be a sandy-haired, long-nosed pessimist, a woman
of fifty, capable, but so sunk in pessimism that Joeys blandishments
failed to win her, and Jingles stood on his hind legs, and pawed his
face in vain.

All through supper she discoursed of microbes and the dangerous
minerals in spring water. She read us a lesson on cleanliness,
repudiated the soda in the biscuits, and looked askance at the liberal
amount of cream I took in my coffee.

Cream has a deleterious effect on the liver, she informed me, looking
down her nose sourly, while Joey wrinkled his small face, appeared
distressed at the turn the conversation was taking, and gasped forth:

Why, Mr. David, do people have livers same as chickens?

Mrs. Olds sniffed, Wanza looked out of the window and bit her lips, and
I shook my head at Joey.

My dear Mrs. Olds, I said cheerfully, there is nothing the matter
with my liver, I assure you.

She looked me over critically, inquired my age, and when I told her
thirty-two, remarked darkly that I was young yet.

When Wanza and I were left alone in the kitchen, I had time to observe
Wanzas hair. It made me think of the flaxen curls on the heads of the
French dolls I had seen displayed in the shop-windows at Christmas
time. Each curl was crisp and glossy, and hung in orderly, beauteous
exactness, and the little part in the centre of her head was even, and
white as milk. Palely as her hair was wont to gleam, it shone still
paler now, until in some lights it was almost of silvery fairness and
indescribable sheen. Beneath it, her blue eyes looked almost black, her
complexion had the rare whiteness of alabaster. There could be no two
opinions on the subject--Wanza had washed her hair.

I knocked together a crude cot covered with a bit of canvas, on which
Mrs. Olds and Wanza were to take turns sleeping in the kitchen, and I
soldered an old canteen to be used as a hot-water bottle at the big
mans feet. And I did sundry small errands that Mrs. Olds required of
me before I was dismissed for the night. But when Joey and I closed the
kitchen door behind us and stole away in the darkness beneath the yews
to our new sleeping quarters in the workshop, I went with an effulgent
glow and rapture at my heart. She was beneath my roof. She was eating
my bread. The room on which I had labored through many an arduous day
out of love and compassion for Joey had become a haven of refuge for my
wonder woman.




CHAPTER XI

THE KICKSHAW


THE doctor came early the next morning and he rendered me incredibly
favorable reports of both his patients; so that I was able to buoy
myself up with the hope of seeing Haidee before many days had passed.
She sent me a series of charming messages by Wanza throughout the day.
The first message was to the effect that the room was delicious and
the bed like down. Again--the air through the open windows and door
was sweet as the breath of asphodel. And the last message said that
the outlook through the windows was so sylvan that almost she expected
to hear the pipes of Pan, or see a faun perched upon the rocks, or a
Psyche at the pool.

I hugged these gracious words to my heart, and began work at once on a
reclining-chair in which Haidee could rest during her convalescence,
and the fashioning of two little crutches of cedar, the doctor having
confided to me that when Haidee left her bed she would require the
support of crutches for a week or two.

The second day, the message from the cedar room thrilled me: Tell Mr.
Dale that I have been lifted high on my pillows where I can watch Joey
at work in the Dingle. Later on the question came: Joey is making
something. What is it?

Joey was passing through the kitchen when I received this message. I
called to him: What are you doing in the Dingle, Joey?

Pooh, he said, puffing out his cheeks, Im not doing anything!

Nothing at all, Joey?

Im just covering a cedar round for a--a hassock for her--Bell
Brandons feet when she sits up. Im covering it with the skin of that
mink you trapped last fall.

I duly reported this to Wanza. She looked at me, tossed her head,
and went quickly back to the cedar room. I began to think Mrs. Olds
pessimism was infecting her. Certainly my bright, insouciant Wanza
seemed changed to me since her installation at Haidees bedside.

I received messages too, from the sick man, but disjointed, vague
outbursts that showed his mind was still wandering in the realms of
fantasy.

Tell my host, he begged Mrs. Olds, that Im a sick man--a very sick
man. Tell him I say Im a gentleman--a perfect gentleman. Tell him hes
a gentleman, too. _Noblesse oblige_--and all that sort of thing, you
know.

Mrs. Olds gathered that he was a mining man from Alaska, with interests
in the Cur dAlenes, and that his name was Bailey. She had discovered
a leather wallet in his coat pocket with the name in gold letters on
the flap, and his linen was marked with a B. Pending absolute certainty
that his name was Bailey, we all, with the exception of Mrs. Olds,
continued to designate him the big man; and as days went on, Joey
added to this and called him the big bad man, for his language waxed
coarser. He was almost violent at times, and I was glad that the tiny
corridor separated Haidees room from the one in which he lay.

The doctor diagnosed his case as typhoid, and promised us a speedy
convalescence. He looked at me significantly and added: Hell recover.
But when he goes to that unknown bourne, finally, he may not depart by
a route as respectable by far. Hes a periodical drinker--about all in.
Cant stand much more.

A few days after this I received an unexpected order for a cedar chest
from a writer who signed herself Janet Jones, and directed that the
chest when completed, should be sent to Spokane.

I have seen your cedar chests, she wrote. And how I want one! I am
a shut in--and I want the beauty chest in my boudoir, because it will
remind me of the cool, green cedars in the depth of the forest, of wood
aisles purpling at twilight, of ferns and grass and all the plushy,
dear, delightful things that bend and blow and flaunt themselves in the
summer breeze. When I look at it, I am sure I can hear again the voice
of the tortuous, swift-running, shadowy river on whose banks it was
made. And I long to hear that sound again.

The check she enclosed was a generous one. The letter seemed almost a
sacred thing to me. I folded it carefully and laid it away, and not
even to Joey did I mention the order I had received. But I began work
at once on the cedar chest. And I labored faithfully, and with infinite
relish. The check was a material help to me, and something prompted me
to lay bare my heart and tell my new friend so in the note of thanks I
penned her that night.

The wood paths are overrun with kinnikinic, lupine, and Oregon grape
just now, I wrote, and the woods are in their greenest livery.
The paint brushes are just coming into bloom and the white flowers
on the salmon berry bushes were never so large before, or the coral
honeysuckle so fragrant. My senses tell me this is so; but there is
a deeper green in the heart of the woods, a tenderer purple on the
mountains, because of one who bides temporarily beneath my roof. And
because of her--oh, kind benefactress, I thank you for your order, for
your praise, and for your check! I am poor--miserably poor. And for the
first time in eight years ashamed of it.

The answer came back in a few days:

Dont be ashamed! Tell me of her, please.

Because the hour of Haidees convalescence when I could greet her face
to face, was postponed from day to day, and because my thoughts were
full of her, I was glad to answer this letter. But after all I told
Janet Jones very little of Haidee, except that she was my guest, and
that Joey and I called her our Wonder Woman, and that my own name for
her was Haidee.

Each day that followed was well rounded out with work. The workshop
proved to be a veritable house of refuge to Joey and me, whither we
fled to escape Mrs. Olds whining voice and bickering, and the big
mans unsavory language. Here with windows wide to the breeze that
swept cool and clean from the mountains we labored side by side,
forgetting the discord within the cabin, realizing only that it is good
to live, to labor and to love.

In addition to my work on the cedar chest I was carving a design of
spirea on a small oak box, which when completed was to hold Joeys few
but highly prized kickshaws. As the design approached completion I
observed the small boy eyeing it almost with dissatisfaction from time
to time.

I was unused to this attitude in Joey, and one day I asked, Dont you
like it, lad?

A spray of the graceful spirea lay on my work bench. He picked it up,
caressed it gently, and laid it aside.

Oh, Mr. David, he said, I do think spirea, the pink kind, is the
cunningest bush that grows!

I had reference to the box, Joey.

His eyes met mine honestly. A flush crept up to his brow through the
tan.

I almost say Gracious Lord! every time I look at it, and you asked me
not to say that any more, Mr. David. It must be most as beautiful as
that fairy box you told me about one day, that the girl carried in her
arms when the boatman poled her across that black river. I do think
youre most too good to me.

I knew then that my boy liked the box beyond cavil.

But I reached the heart of his feeling with regard to the trifle the
following day. As I bent over my work he said tentatively:

I think we ought to do something for Wanza. Shes doing a lot for us,
isnt she, Mr. David?

I glanced up. Joey was sitting cross-legged on my work bench, engaged
in putting burrs together in the shape of a basket.

Yes, I replied, Wanza is very kind.

Then if you dont mind, Mr. David--really truly dont mind--Id like
to give the kickshaw box to her.

The brown eyes that came up to mine were imploring, the small tanned
face was suddenly aquiver with emotion. I laid my tools aside, and
looked thoughtfully out of the window.

Wanzas awfully good to me, Mr. David, the small boy continued.
Shes put patches on my overalls, and sewed buttons on my shirts, and
darned my stockings--and the other day she made me a kite. And she
plays cats cradle with me, and brings me glass marbles. And when she
gets rich shes going to buy me a gold-fish.

What a formidable list of good deeds. The box is Wanzas, I declared,
facing around. We will present it to her this evening.

Do you spose she has any kickshaws to put in it, Mr. David?

Why--I dont know, lad, I dont know, I replied musingly. It seems
to me very probable.

Do girls have kickshaws, Mr. David?

Almost every one has some sort of keepsake, Joey lad.

He surveyed his burr basket with disfavor, tore it apart and began
hurriedly to build it over.

Say the kickshaw verse for me, Mr. David, please, and after that the
Nine Little Goblins, and after that a little bit of Tentoleena.

It was very pleasant there in the shop. The perfume of summer was
about us, and bird-song and bee-humming and the mellow sound of the
brook blended into a delicate wood symphony. I looked out upon the
swift-running, sparkling, clear river. To dip boyishly in it was my
sudden desire. The leafy green of the banks was likewise inviting.
Across the river the grey-blue meadows stretched away to meet the
purple foot hills. I hung halfway out of the window and recited the
tuneful little rhyme for Joey:

  Oh, the tiny little kickshaw that Mither sent tae me,
  Tis sweeter than the sugar-plum that reepens on the tree,
  Wi denty flavorins o spice an musky rosemarie,
  The tiny little kickshaw that Mither sent tae me.

  Oh I love the tiny kickshaw, and I smack my lips wi glee,
  Aye mickle do I love the taste o sic a luxourie,
  But maist I love the lovin hands that could the giftie gie
  O the tiny little kickshaw that Mither sent tae me.

Joey was a rare listener, his face had a sparkle in concentration
seldom seen. It was an inspiration to the retailer. Wherever this is
found, to my notion, it gives to a face an unusual distinction and
charm. As I finished he drew a deep breath.

Mothers gives kickshaws to their girls and boys most always, I
spose, he murmured questioningly. His eyes were wistful, and hurt me
in a strange way.

Almost always, I think, Joey.

I smiled at him, and he smiled back bravely.

Im your boy--almost really and truly your boy--aint I, Mr. David?

I nodded.

Pooh, he said with a swagger, Id liever be your boy than--than
anything! You give me kickshaws and make me magpie cages, and--and
flutes and bow-guns, and you builded me a bed--

He broke off suddenly, and without seeming to look at him I saw that
his eyes were tear filled, and that he was winking fast and furiously
to keep the drops from falling.

Now then, I said, speaking somewhat huskily, I shall give you Nine
Little Goblins. Clearing my throat I began:

  They all climbed up on a high board fence,
  Nine little goblins with green-glass eyes--
  Nine little goblins who had no sense
  And couldnt tell coppers from cold mince pies.

I finished the poem and went on to Tentoleena, saying:

I think Mr. Riley has intended this a bit more for girls than for
boys, however, we love its tinkle, dont we, Joey?

  Up in Tentoleena Land--
      Tentoleena! Tentoleena!
  All the dollies, hand in hand,
      Mina, Nainie, and Serena,
  Dance the Fairy fancy dances,
  With glad songs and starry glances.

If I was a girl--and had a doll--Id never let her get up alone at
Moon-dawn and go out and wash her face in those great big dew-drops
with cream on em. Why--she might get drownded! I wouldnt call her
Christine Braibry, anyway-- Joey delivered himself of this ultimatum
quite in his usual manner. And feeling somewhat relieved I inquired:

What name would you choose, boy--Wanza or--

Not Wanza--no girls name! I wouldnt have a girl-doll! Id fix it up
in pants and call it Mr. David.

After supper that evening I asked Wanza to come to the workshop with
Joey and me. She gave me a laughing glance as I held open the kitchen
door for her, and stood teetering in indecision at the sink with Joey
clinging to her skirt.

There are the dishes to be washed, and Mrs. Batterlys tea to be
carried to her, and the milk pans to scald, and--

Wanza, Joey cried, you must come! Its a surprise.

She danced across the room, tossed her apron on to a chair, and rolled
down her sleeves. Her eyes glowed suddenly black with excitement, her
red lips quirked at the corners. She tossed her head, and all her
snarled mop of hair writhed and undulated about her spirited face. She
sprang outside with the lightness of a kitten followed by Joey, and I
closed the door carefully at Mrs. Olds instigation, and followed her
to the yew path.

The heavy-blossomed service bushes hedged the path like a flowered
wall, silver shadows lay around us, but through the fretwork of tree
branches we saw a mauve twilight settling down over the valley. The
river was a twisting purple cord. In the violet sky a half-lit crescent
moon was swimming like a fairy canoe afloat on a mythical sea. All
objects were soft to the sight--thin and shadowy. The spike-like leaves
above our heads glistened ghostily, the trunks of trees bulked like
curling ominous shapes in the vista before us. Puffs of wind caused the
maples to make faint, pattering under-breaths of sound.

We stood on the miniature bridge for a moment. The reeds were shooting
up in the bed of the spring; and as we stood on the bridge they were
almost waist high about us. A tule wren flew from among them, perched
on a nearby cottonwood, and gave a series of short wild notes for our
edification. It flirted about on its perch, with many a bob and twitch
as we watched it, apparently scolding at us for daring to approach so
close to its habitat.

And we stood there in the musical, colorful twilight, my thoughts flew
to Haidee, and I asked Wanza how she was faring.

Well enough, she retorted, with a swift back flinging of her blonde
head.

Well enough means very well, does it, Wanza?

If you cant make me out, Mr. Dale, I guess I better quit talking.
Seems like you never used to have no trouble.

I believe I am growing obtuse, I replied lightly. And led the way
across the bridge to the shop without further ado.

Had I dreamed that Wanza would have been so affected by the simple gift
I tendered, I doubt if I would have had sufficient temerity to present
it to her. I did this with a flourish, saying:

You have been so kind to Joey and me, Wanza, that we beg you to accept
this little kickshaw case in token of our appreciation. Joey hunted out
the finest specimens of spirea for me, and I carved the lid, as you
see, and cut your initials here in the corner.

Ah, the light in the brilliant deep blue eyes raised to mine! the smile
on the tender lips, the sobbing breath with which she spoke. I was
stirred and vaguely abashed.

You did this for me--for me, she repeated, laughing, and shaking her
head, and all but weeping. She clasped the box close to her girlish
breast with a huddling movement of her arms, sank her chin upon it,
caressed the smooth wood with her cheek. Its beautiful, beautiful!
Oh, thank you, Mr. Dale, thank you! Joey was cuddling against her
shoulder and she put her arm out after a moment, took him into her
embrace and kissed him with a soft lingering pressure of her lips
against his.

When she stood upright at length her face was wreathed in smiles, and
though I spied a tear on her lashes, it was with a ringing laugh that
she said:

I know what a box is, and I guess I know a case when I see it, but
youll have to tell me what a kickshaw is, Mr. Dale.

I laughed heartily. And then Joey would have me recite Rileys
delicious little rhyme. The evening ended pleasantly for us all.
But it left me with food for musing. Yes, I said to myself, Wanza
was kind--she had ever been kind to Joey and me. Had I been too
cavalier in my treatment of her? Remembering her sudden softening,
her appreciation of my small gift, I decided this was so. In future,
I assured myself, I would show her every consideration. Wanza was
growing up. She was no child to be hectored, and bantered, cajoled and
then neglected. No! My treatment of her must be uniformly courteous
hereafter.




CHAPTER XII

IN SHOP AND DINGLE


IT seemed to me during the next few days that Wanza bloomed magically;
as she worked she chirruped, her feet were light, a bird seemed to sing
in her breast. I knew not to what to attribute the change. She was
still the debonair girl, but she was wholly woman; and she was vital as
a spirit, beautiful as a flower. We grew vastly companionable.

We walked together along the flowery riverways in the twilight; at
night we watched the ribbons of clouds tangle into pearly folds across
the moons face, and the stars grow bright in the purple urn of heaven.
Mornings we climbed the heights and gathered wild strawberries for
Haidees luncheon, and often in the late afternoon Wanza would come to
the shop and I would help her with her studies.

It was pleasant, too, to take the glasses, and penetrate deep into
the heart of the greenwood and sit immovable among the shrubbery,
bird-spying, as Joey called it. It was Wanzas delight to see me
stand perfectly still in a certain spot near the shop, where a bed of
fragrant old-fashioned pinks frequently absorbed my attention, and wait
for the sparrows and nuthatches that often came to alight on my head.
Inside my shop I was tending a young cedar waxwing that had dropped at
my feet from a cherry tree near the cabin one morning. Joey had given
the bird assiduous attention, and was overjoyed when a few days later
he found it friendly enough to sit on his hand. We named the bird,
Silly Cedar. And I made him a roomy cage of slender cedar sticks. He
seldom inhabited the cage, however, choosing rather to flutter freely
about the workshop.

Wanzas joy in the birds was a pleasure to witness. I was at my work
bench one morning, when chancing to glance through the open window I
saw a charming picture. The girl stood by the bed of clove pinks, a
veritable pink and white Dresden shepherdess in one of the stiffest,
most immaculate of her cotton frocks, her hair an unbound, pale-flaming
banner about her shoulders. On her head was poised a nuthatch.

It was the expression of her face that captivated me,--smiling, rapt,
almost prayerful, as if invoking the spirit of all aerial things.
Both arms were out as though she were balancing the dainty object
that perched so delicately upon her head. In every fibre she appeared
electrified, as though about to soar with the birds. Again I had that
sensation of glimpsing beneath the girls casual self and finding a
transfigured being.

The bird fluttered away as I gazed, Wanza stooped, gathering the
flowers, and I went out to her.

She flirted the pinks beneath her chin as she looked up at me.

Ive been up since five, she laughed. Even her laugh was subdued.

And what have you been doing since five? I asked idly.

She opened a box that lay on the grass at her side.

Ive been up on Nigger Head after these. I saw them yesterday when I
went to old Lundquists to take him a bit of cottage cheese Id made.
See!

I looked as she bade me. Within the box were some fine specimens of
ferns and swamp laurel, and a rare white blossom that I had never seen
in western woods. An airy, dainty, frosty-white, tiny star-flower.

They are for you. I heard you wishing for swamp laurel.

You are very, very kind, Wanza, I replied.

I lifted the laurel, but my eyes were on the white flower, and my heart
was overcharged, and as I looked a blur crossed my vision and I could
not see the waxen petals. But I saw another woods, lush and sweet, hard
by a southern homestead, I heard the darkies singing in the fields
adjoining, and the sound of the river running between red clay banks. I
saw my mothers smile.

I felt weak at that moment. I needed to grip hard a friendly hand.
Nothing, not God, is greater to one than ones self is, and whoever
walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own funeral drest in his
shroud. Walt Whitman spoke truly. Someway I knew that Wanzas sympathy
was true and exquisite, that her understanding was profound. I had
never before thought of this, but suddenly I knew that it was so. She
tendered me the little white flower on her open palm, and I reached out
and took it and I took her hand, saying:

You are a good girl, Wanza Lyttle.

My tongue was ineffectual to say what I would have said, and so I said
nothing. The white of her face crimsoned as I held her hand. Her blue
eyes said a thousand things I could not sense. But her lips merely
murmured, What is the swamp laurel for, Mr. Dale?

I want to make a design of laurel for a tray I intend to carve. You
see, Wanza, I am beginning already to think of the holiday trade. At
Christmas I shall send some of my work to the city to an art store
there.

We passed on to the workshop, and presently Joey joined us there.

It seems to me, Mr. David, he said as he entered, that to-day is
yesterday.

I smiled at him appreciatively. I had come to call Joey my philosopher
in knee breeches. He resumed, puffing out his cheeks in his
characteristic way, Cause I been so busy. I guess if a body was busy
enough there wouldnt be no time.

We make our own limitations, Joey, I said, bending over my cedar
chest that was all but finished. The Now is the principal thing, boy.

Mrs. Olds is the queerest lady, he went on, always watching the
clock. An she dont like our ways, Mr. David--she said so! She says
were slip-shod. Hit and miss, she says, thats the way we live. My,
shes funny! At night she says, Well, Im glad this day is over,
an in the morning she says, Dear me! I thought it would never come
morning! Im glad the night is gone. I said to her--I said to her--
Joey paused, having used up his breath, and requiring a fresh supply.

Go slowly, I advised. What did you say, Joey? Get a good breath and
tell Wanza and me.

I said: How can you hate both times? It keeps you busy hating, dont
it? An if youre busy hating, Mr. David, what time do you get to feed
the birds, an watch the squirrels, an make burr baskets and cedar
chests, an bow-guns and flutes?

Joey put his head on one side and looked up at me inquiringly out of
his bright shrewd eyes.

Not much time, Im afraid, Joey, I responded, knowing that he
expected a reply.

Of course not. Come here, Silly Cedar, he called softly to the
Waxwing. He gave a musical whistling note, and the bird, that was
perched on the work bench, flew to him and alighted on his outstretched
hand. He made a picture that I was to remember in other sadder days,
standing thus, holding the bird, scarce moving, so great was his
ecstasy.

Very soon after this the chair reached completion. Upholstered in
burlap and stuffed with moss, it stood in the small rustic pergola
outside the cedar room, awaiting Haidee. Joeys hassock rested beside
it. And at last one day after I had worked myself into a state of fine
frenzy at the delay I was told that she was sitting in state in the new
chair awaiting me. I hurried to the Dingle, parted the underbrush, and
stood gazing at my wonder woman before she was aware of my coming.

She sat leaning back in the big chair. She looked very weary and pale
as she reclined there. The rough silk of her robe was blue--the rare
blue sometimes seen in paintings of old Madonnas. Her lovely throat was
bare. Her creamy hands with their pink-tinted nails lay idly clasped in
her lap; and her feet, resting on Joeys hassock, were shod in strange
Oriental flat-heeled slippers with big drunken-looking rosettes on the
toes.

You are quite recovered? I asked, stepping forward.

Oh, Mr. Dale! she cried, and seemed unable to proceed. And I found
myself bending above her with both of her hands in mine, looking down
into her shadowy, mysterious eyes.

I summoned my voice at last, and spoke rather indistinctly: Joey and I
have been awaiting your convalescence impatiently. Joey has been very
anxious about his Bell Brandon, as he calls you.

She still sat with her hands in mine, and she looked up at me with a
strangely quiet gaze and replied gravely: I like Joeys name for me.
Does he really call me that?

Why, I said, I have even ventured to call you so in mentioning you
to Joey.

I released her hands and seated myself on the steps below her. There
was a silence. The sun slipped behind a cloud. The shadows in the
Dingle deepened to invisible green velvet. In the perfume and hush I
could hear my heart beat. It was very still. A cat-bird called from the
thicket, the hum of bees buzzing among the clover in the meadow came to
us with a sabbath sound.

Haidee looked at me and smiled. It is very restful here. How is your
other patient progressing?

Very well, I believe.

This is a splendid sanatorium. I had some wonderful dreams in that
cedar room.

I should like to hear about them. I am curious to know what dreams
the room induced, I answered, with rather too much impressment, Im
afraid.

She leaned her head against the burlapped chair back and lowered her
lashes against her cheek. I studied her face. During her illness she
seemed to have undergone a subtle transformation. There were lines
about her drooping eyes, something cold and almost austere in the
expression of her face that I had not noticed before. She seemed
farther from me than she had yet seemed--immeasurably remote.

The dreams were very good dreams--restful dreams.

Yes, I said gently.

They were dreams of homey things--simple, plain things--and yet there
was a zest in them--a repose--a complete forgetfulness.

Forgetfulness?

Yes. Isnt forgetfulness the Nirvana of the Hindu? If we remember
we may regret. If we have no thought backward or forward, we are
blissfully quiescent.

I watched a yellow warbler preening itself on a swinging bough of a
tamarack. It is easier to have no thought forward--perhaps, I said
slowly after a pause.

You think so, too? I am sure of it. The past is an insistent thing--a
ghoulish thing--waving shrouded arms over the present. To forget!--ah,
theres the rub.

She spoke precipitately, turning her head restlessly this way and that
on the rough cushion. The line of her throat, the tiny fluffy ringlets
at the roots of her hair, the curve of her lovely cheek, stirred my
blood strangely.

Tell me something more of yourself, I blurted out abruptly.

She started. Her eyes grew bleak, worn with memories, it seemed; her
face that had shone warmly pale, changed and stiffened to marble. She
answered in a cold, slight voice: There is so little to tell. After
awhile she added: Perhaps some day you will tell me your story.

I sat and watched the yellow warbler, reflecting on the strange relief
it would be to recite to sympathetic ears my pent-up dreary tale, my
baleful tale of a scourging past, of present loneliness and hard plain
living. It was the sort of tale that is never told--unless the teller
be a driveller. I laughed cheerlessly, and someway the brightness of
the hour was clouded by the phantom of the past that Haidees words
had invoked. And the phantom dared to stand even at the gate of the
future and demand toll, so that neither past, present nor future was a
thing to rejoice in.

My face must have grown grim. I clenched and unclenched my hand on my
knee. Haidees voice continued: But in the meantime you dont know
me--the real every day me--and I dont know you--the real you; and its
interesting, rather, to speak to each other, like sliding wraith-like
ships that pass to opposite ports. We fling our voices out--then
darkness again--and a silence.

I am what I am, I answered quickly.

She nodded concurrence. Dear me! Of course. But you were not always
what you are now. Thats the point. And, some day, I shall persuade you
to tell me all.

I answered pointedly: In the words of Olivia, you might do much.

She laughed oddly, almost amusedly, at my vehemence, and swayed back a
little from me as I held out my hand. Good-bye, I said, for to-day.
And when she yielded me her hand I pressed it lightly and let it go.

I had never tried, until that moment, to analyze the quality of my
sentiment for Haidee. I had been filled with a vague romantic idealism
where my wonder woman was concerned, but suddenly I was restless, and
dissatisfied with idealising. I wanted to know Judith Batterly--the
real woman. I wanted to pierce the veil of mysticism in which she was
wrapped. I was not content with the artificiality of our discourse. It
seemed to me I failed to strike a note truly sound in any of our talks.
The real woman eluded me. I could not bring Haidee down to my plane
from the dream-world where only she seemed to function. She was ever
remote. And I wanted to understand fully my feeling for her.

When I fell asleep that night, dreams of Haidee and Wanza were
commingled. Once I awoke, dressed completely, and walked outside the
workshop in the clear, balmy air of the night. I lay down on the river
bank and watched a particularly big bright star that hung just over
the crest of Nigger Head. I thought of Wanza--of her new and gentler
ways that were replacing the old crisp brightness of demeanor--and I
smiled. I thought of Haidee--and I sighed. Then my thoughts flew to the
kickshaw case I had given Wanza and her reception of it, and to the
swamp laurel she had risen at daybreak to gather for me, and thinking
of these things I went back to the workshop and crept in beside Joey,
and with my arm about the lad slept dreamlessly till morning.




CHAPTER XIII

DEFICIENCIES


ABOUT this time I wrote in my diary: A man in love is an oaf. How
awkward and lumbering he is in the presence of his Dulcinea. How
undesirable and like a clod away from her. He is a churl to every one
but the one woman. I have been out in the sun-splashed forest searching
for rare specimens of the wood anemone for my wonder woman. My search
absorbed my morning, and I quite forgot that I had promised Wanza to
ride to town for flour for the weekly baking. I dreamed and mused the
hours away among the basaltic boulders in a strange grove of twisted
yews, where nereid green pools lie in little hollows and maiden hair
springs up through the gold-brown moss carpet. This grove has long been
a favorite of mine. It has a classical aspect; there is something about
it that suggests a train of mythological conceptions. I feel sure that
the great God Pan must be fashioning his flute among the rushes in
the bed of the spring. In the winds sibilance I hear the skirl of the
Pandean pipes. I recall the divine huntress, and summon up visions of
Iris, the goddess of many colors.

This morning the wood spaces were filled with visions of Haidee. She
smiled at me from behind the clumps of bracken and huckleberry, her
eyes beamed at me from the hearts of the flowers. The clouds were her
garments, the blue sky her soul. As Dante walked dreaming of Beatrice
so went I with Haidee ever before me.

Love is a rejuvenating precious thing. Even a hopeless love softens
the fibres of ones entire being, and straightens the warped soul of
one. But I must not reach out toward Love! I must renounce. I must go
on alone, like a battered, wrecked, drifting derelict. I have thought
the blackest part of my life behind me. I have come to look forward too
much. I have vented my heavy heart, and found solace in work and books.
And now! I must live through the culminating sorrow. Is all my life to
be one great renunciation? I find myself rebelling. I have been too
much the helpless victim of circumstances. For me Ossa has been heaped
on Pelion.

I have said, If I can but avoid comparing my lot with what it might
have been, I can be a man. I have repeated: I swear the earth shall
surely be complete to him or her who shall be complete. The earth
remains jagged and broken only to him or her who remains jagged and
broken. I have said all this to myself times innumerable. And now what
shall I say to myself? I can scarcely whisper to myself, Courage! I
am baffled, balked, stunned. Oh, what do I signify in the scheme of
things! I am a bit of washed spindrift. Glad should I be to surrender
the quick of being. If it were not for work!-- Through labor only
I come near to God, the master artizan, who labors tirelessly and
marvelously.

After making this entry in my diary I gained an unexpected surcease
from wearied thoughts. I went on with my life calmly enough, doing
the things nearest to hand, eating three good meals a day as a man
will, writing on my novel evenings, and sleeping normally, with Joey
curled into a warm little ball at my side. In some strange way after my
descent into Avernus I became tranquil in every pulse. After brooding
over much I sat back, figuratively speaking, and thought of nothing,
but the simple joy of being. Sunlight was pure gold, the dew silver,
each twilight a benediction, each dawn a natal hymn. I managed so that
I saw very little of Haidee, paying my respects to her once a day, and
pleading work as an excuse if invited to linger in the shady Dingle
where she sat with her work or a book. I contemplated sending Joey to
school in the autumn, and a portion of each day I devoted to teaching
the small lad spelling. His remarks concerning the rite were often
pungent. He persevered to please me, but I could see that in his heart
he pitied me for my zealous attempts on his behalf.

When people can say things whats the use of spelling? he asked
one day. He held his book upside down, his eyes fixed longingly on a
skimming prismatic cloud of butterflies beyond the workshop door. I
can say God--whats the good of spelling it? I did not respond, and
evidently anxious to convince me further, he added: Yes. And one time
once--oh, when I was teenty, Mr. David, I thought I saw him.

Do you think now that you saw him, Joey? I questioned, half smiling.

Well, he replied slowly, as if pondering the matter, I was sure
then, Mr. David.

Where did you see the--er--person whom you believed to be God? I
asked.

In the village.

Did he speak to you, Joey?

Joey looked at me slyly.

Oh, Mr. David, he whispered deprecatingly, do you spose Id spect
him to--when Im a worm?

I went on with the lesson, vaguely wondering what sort of mind the lady
who taught Joey at Sunday School was possessed of.

At the conclusion of the lesson, Joey observed: Mrs. Olds says our
cabin is full of de--deficiencies, Mr. David. What do de--deficiencies
do?

Deficiencies let flies in, and permit mice to molest the flour
barrel,--deficiencies make chimneys smoke, and floors creak.

Hm! Are de--deficiencies holes, Mr. David?

In a sense, lad.

Whered be the fun, though, my loyal lad cried out, if there werent
no holes in cabins. Thered be nothing to patch. An youd never see a
rat poke his cunning head through the wall cold nights when you sit by
the fire. Pooh! I like de--deficiencies.

That very day I went about setting what traps I had to catch the
rodents that were destroying Mrs. Olds peace of mind. And I began the
manufacture of others. I also mended the screen doors, and purchased a
package of mosquito netting from Wanzas cart, for the windows.

It was a curious mnage I captained. I found myself grinning from time
to time as I took orders from Mrs. Olds. Although I was in love with
Haidee, and although Joey was an entertaining companion, and although
I found Mrs. Olds pessimism a curious study, it was to Wanza that I
turned most frequently for comfort and advice during these trying days.
We had many a rueful laugh together at Mrs. Olds expense.

The whole thing with her, I do think, Wanza said, one day, is
drawing her pay.

But Wanza maligned her. Mrs. Olds was a rare nurse, conscientious to
a fault. And she received little enough pay from the big man, I knew.
Wanza had a cot in the cedar room now, and Mrs. Olds was able to rest
the greater part of the night, as her patients condition improved.




CHAPTER XIV

JACK OF ALL TRADES


IN due time I received another communication from my unknown friend.
Very brief it was. It said:

  I appreciate your confidence. I am glad to know of Haidee. But I
  want still more to know of yourself. Can you trust me?

I did not answer this at once, revolving it in my mind. A few days
later I wrote in this wise:

  There is little to know, kind friend. Eight years ago, when I was
  twenty-four, I came to Idaho. I took up a homestead on the Cur
  dAlene River. I proved up on it, and I have sold all but sixteen
  acres. I have worked hard. I have grown horny-handed, weather-beaten
  and a bit gray. I live in a flannel shirt and corduroy trousers,
  and I eat off a pine table in the kitchen of a three-roomed shack.
  Lately, I have developed into a craftsman. It is a sordid enough
  tale--is it not?

Conversations with Haidee were still infrequent. Wanza ordinarily
shared them, and Joey was nearly always present.

We were seated in a group about the pool in the Dingle, one morning,
Haidee in her chair, Joey at her feet with Jingles asleep at his side,
Wanza on the brink of the pool with her tatting, gazing in from time to
time at the reflection of her pale blonde loveliness, while I, seated
on a stump of a pine tree, was carving a bow-gun for Joey.

There was a white syringa bush above Haidee that was dropping pale
flowers on her head. They seemed to me like perfumed petals of
Paradise. I caught one as it fell, smiling into her tranquil eyes.
I said to myself that with each succeeding day Haidees voice grew
lighter, her laughter more frequent, her expression brighter.

As we sat there, an entrancing harmony arose about us. Waves of
ecstatic melody swelled and softened and swelled again through the
green fragrant woods. Trills on one hand, deep throaty mellow carolings
on the other. The thrush, the warbler, the sparrow joined in a mighty
chorus.

What a magnificent orchestra, Haidee cried. The birds are holding
high carnival.

The pearl-like, throbbing symphony grew sweeter and sweeter. We sat
spellbound drinking in the enchantment with hungry ears. Suddenly I
cried:

Look! There is a lazuli-bunting.

I pointed to the feathered blue beauty that was winging its way to a
nearby maple.

Lazuli-bunting? Haidee echoed. What a cosy name. I suppose the baby
birds are called baby buntings, Joey.

Joey looked up in her face with adoration in his brown eyes, and she
moved a little forward and pressed his head gently back against her
knee. They contemplated each other with a sort of radiant satisfaction.

No one ever told me about baby buntings, Joey declared at last.

What a shame! Mr. Dale, do you know you have neglected Joeys
education?

Very slowly and prettily Haidee repeated the old rhyme, her fingers
stroking the lads sunburnt cheek. Wanzas eyes were very big and
strangely burning as they rested on her. And her lips were drawn into
a straight, unlovely red line as she finally dropped her regard to her
tatting. I carved in silence, and the lazuli-bunting was forgotten as
the recital of the nursery rhyme led to the demand for others.

Wanza, I teased, going up behind her in the kitchen later, and
reaching round to tickle her chin with a ribbon grass as she bent over
the ironing board. Wanza, why so pensive? Where are your smiles?

She smiles enough for both, Wanza retorted, giving an angry flirt
to the ruffle she was ironing. I dont know which is the worst--your
smiley kind or your everlasting scolds. Mrs. Olds would sour the
cream--and Mrs. Batterlys eternal smirk makes me think of a sick calf.
And when I feel like rushing around and biting the furniture its just
enough to kill me, so it is, to have her so purry and mealy-mouthed.

But why should you want to rush around and bite the furniture? I
asked in bewilderment.

Oh, just because Im a great big rough, mean-tempered country girl!
Ive never had real bringing up. Tears stood in Wanzas stormy eyes.
No perfect lady ever felt like biting anything. Oh, please go away,
Mr. Dale, and leave me be--Im cross and tired--and not fit to be
noticed!

I saw Mrs. Olds smiling palely at me from the door of the sick room.
She tiptoed forward.

Hush, she whispered. My patient is asleep. He is quite rational, Mr.
Dale. In a few days he will be able to sit up.

With Mrs. Olds permission I went in and stood at the bedside and
looked down at the sleeping man. He was thin and his face was lean and
white. He looked a very different being from the man who had staggered
into the cabin that night in the storm. He looked more nearly a man as
God intended him to look. His brow was high, his jaw clean cut, his
hair grew luxuriantly on his well-shaped head. But his mouth beneath
the brown moustache was loose-lipped, self indulgent, and obstinate.
And there was something hateful to me in the set of his thick neck on
his big shoulders.

I returned to the kitchen. It was very hot in the small room, and the
steam that arose from a kettle of soup on the stove as Wanza lifted the
lid assailed my nose and eyes unpleasantly. I opened the door to allow
the steam to escape, and Wanza spoke hastily:

Shut the door, Mr. Dale, please, youre cooling off the oven, and Im
baking this morning.

Does a whiff of air like that cool your oven? I asked curiously.

Well, I should say so. My, its hot in here! I looked at her red
face, and as I did so an inspiration came to me. Wanza, I said, why
should I not make you a fireless cooker?

She stared at me.

Is there any reason why you would not like one? I queried.

Glory! Id like one right enough.

Come to the workshop after dinner, I rejoined, and we will discuss
it.

Wanza came to the shop later in the afternoon and I convinced her that
the construction of a fireless cooker was a bagatelle to a skilled
craftsman such as I considered myself to be. Her face flamed with the
fire of her enthusiasm. She caught my hand, and cried:

Youre a fixing man, all right! You sure are.

I had never seen her blue eyes so softly grateful before. They were
like humid flowers. Her voice was full and low. Her hand pressed my
hand, and clung. Seeing her thus moved I stammered:

Why, I seem to be a sort of Jack of all trades. A Jack of all trades
is master of none, usually. Her face was very close to mine, and what
with her strange witchery and her appealing wistfulness I might have
said more; but as I gazed at her my senses untangled, and I locked
my lips. I shook my head at her, and I smiled a little deprecatingly
and loosed my hand as she murmured: I think youre just grand--just
grand! Youre kind as kind can be. Oh, Mr. David Dale, you sure are a
good, good fellow!

All of this because I am going to try to turn out some sort of
fireless cooker, I remonstrated.

Youre always trying to do something--for somebody--trying to help
along--thats it. It aint so much just this.

Wanza was rather incoherent as she turned and walked out of the shop.
And someway instead of her words of commendation heartening me they
left me dejected. But the cooker was a success. A stout box, lined
with asbestos, a receptacle of tin, and sawdust for packing turned
the trick. And the corned-beef and cabbage that Wanza, the conjurer,
straightway evolved from this crude contrivance left nothing to be
desired.

The chicken Wanza cooked one day soon after was so unusually succulent
that we decided at once to ride to the village before supper and carry
Captain Grif a generous portion.

Hell relish a bit of chicken after so much pork and corn bread, and
such living. I can warm it up on the stove for him, and stir up some
biscuits, while you and him are having a game of chess on the porch,
Wanza announced.

Accordingly we rode away over the ploughed field together at about five
oclock, Mrs. Olds watching us dourly from the kitchen doorway, and
Joey yelling after us: Ill see to Bell Brandon while youre away.

Captain Grifs was the warmest of welcomes.

Well, well, well, he said, rising from his rocker on the front porch
as we mounted the steps, and here you be, the two of ye--and better
than a crowd, I say! By golly, s-ship-mate, youre a sight for sore
eyes. You looked peaked, too, and Wanza aint at her best. But sit
right down--Wanza, theres the hammock--the hammock I slept in many a
night at sea--plump into that now.

He beamed at his daughter. It was good to see his pride and delight in
her.

Dad, Wanza said, wagging her bright head at him, something told us
you was pining for chicken--chicken with dumpling, Dad. Its in this
pail. You sit here with Mr. Dale, and Ill get out the chessmen, and
while youre playing Ill warm up the stew. Then when youve had your
bite with us, Ill play on the melodeon--Ill play Bell Mahone--and
you and Mr. Dale can sit on the porch and watch the moon come up, and
you can tell him stories; and pretty soon Ill come out, after I have
tidied up, and go to sleep in the hammock.

It all fell out as Wanza planned. We had our bite together; I helped
carry the dishes to the sink in the kitchen while Captain Grif filled
his pipe; and then Wanza played on the melodeon and sang Bell Mahone,
and Wait for the Wagon, and Bonnie Eloise, while Captain Grif and
I chatted on the porch. The moon came up later, and Wanza swung in the
hammock and dozed, or pretended to, while her father told me one story
after another. The central figure of many of his tales was Dockery--the
ships steward--whom he described as a bald-pated, middle-aged man,
with a round face, a Mephistophelean smile, and the helpless frown
of a baby. A curious m-mixture that feller! I was some time readin
him--but I read him. He want very sharp--that was his trouble mostly.
Its a trouble lots of us is afflicted with. Them as knows it I have a
sort o respect for--them as dont I bominate, I sure do, s-ship-mate.
Ignorance itself is bad enough, but when its mixed proper with
conceit, theys no standin it. In this wise old Grif would discourse
much to our edification.

To-night he was hugely interested in dissecting the big mans character
from bits concerning him Wanza and I had dropped.

I dont take no stock in him, boy--Ive told Wanza so from the
first--with all his nightshirts embroidered like an old ladys
antimacassar! And when he gets to settin up, and needs waitin on, I
want Wanza should make herself scarce. The gal tells me she thinks he
is a rich man. Well, may be--may be; that dont mend matters if hes a
rascal.

At this juncture Wanza yawned, tossed her arms abroad, and said
sleepily:

Hes a gentleman, Dad.

Old Grif chuckled.

Now, what do you mean by that? A gentleman! Ump! Ive never knowed the
time I aint heard somebody called a gentleman that hadnt any more
call to be considered a gentleman than your pap here. A gentleman, hey?
you mean he has clothes made by a tailor and money in his pockets, and
goes to the barber frequent, probably takes a bath every day--runnin
water in his room at home, you guess? Hum--well--yes--hes a gentleman
cording to them standards. I got my own standard I measure men by,
thank God.

In his excitement Captain Grif rose from his chair and limped back and
forth on the porch, thumping his cane down hard at each step. He went
on:

Now, Dale, here--_hes_ a gentleman. You bet he is. He aint got no
initial embroidered on _his_ shirts--aint got morn two, likely. He
aint got no runnin water in _his_ house--but he douses himself in the
river every day; and he shaves himself. Its some work for _him_ to get
himself up presentable. Taint no credit to a feller to keep clean when
he has a shower bath in his closet. He was chuckling again, and Wanza
ventured to say:

I call him a gentleman because--hes different--thats what he is. He
dont talk or look or act like any one in these parts. I like him. I
think I could earn a bit amusing him when he is able to sit up, Dad.

Youll march right back home here if I hear of your tryin it, gal,
mark me, now!

But, Dad, youre not fair! Why, he may be the best man living. You
havent ever laid your eyes on him.

I knows it--I knows it, Wanza. I may sound a leetle mite prejudiced;
but I aint--oh, no! Im fair-minded; but Im a reader of character,
and I can tell as much by a mans nightshirts as some of these here
phrenologists can tell by the bumps on his head. The minute you said he
had flowers and initials worked on his nightshirts that minute I said
to myself, He aint no good; and you mark my words, he aint.

Going home, Wanza said to me:

Poor Dad, hes terribly suspicious, aint he, Mr. Dale?

A little, Wanza, perhaps.

Youre suspicious, too, David Dale. You dont think the big man is a
gentleman.

I considered.

I think he would be called a gentleman, Wanza.

She tossed her head.

I do think hes the handsomest man--and the smartest man, seems! And I
like embroidered underclothes. So there!




CHAPTER XV

I BEGIN TO WONDER ABOUT WANZA


SOMETIMES I grew perverse, and went about the tedious common round of
my tread-mill existence doggedly, taking umbrage at Mrs. Olds for the
many unnecessary, trivial services she exacted. She seemed to delight
in keeping my neck under the yoke. There was always a door sagging
on its hinges, a knife that needed a new handle, a lamp or two that
she or Wanza had forgotten to fill. The mice that I took from the
traps each morning were legion. They were Mrs. Olds favorite topic
of conversation at breakfast time. How one small cabin could harbor
so fierce and vast a horde I could scarce conceive. I believe I half
suspected Mrs. Olds of emulating the pied piper, and rounding them up
from the fields and woods. I was appointed custodian of the wood-rats
traps, as well. These were taken alive; and one morning I slyly let one
escape beneath my tormentors chair. Jingles saved the situation by
pouncing on the rodent and snapping his teeth together on its neck. I
came to have small appetite for breakfast.

I began each day by carrying water from the spring to fill the barrel
outside the kitchen door. Mrs. Olds was apt to mount guard over the
barrel during this period, to see that no earwigs or bits of leaves
went into it from the pail. She was very particular to have the barrel
kept sweet and clean, and every second day I scrubbed and rinsed
the inside. She required very fine wood for the kitchen stove for
quick fires when she desired to heat her patients food; and for the
fireplace in the front room she asked me to select other wood than
cedar, cedar being prone to crackle and snap. I was well nigh staggered
with the knowledge of how a womans housekeeping differs from a mans.
Joey and I had felt no lack in the good old days. I smiled to see
my lads eyes open widely at Mrs. Olds occasional reference to our
pitiful attempts at housekeeping.

Are our housekeeping pitiful? he invariably asked me later.

But though I swallowed my rising gorge, and managed to work under Mrs.
Olds coercion, there was ample time left in which to labor at the
simple tasks I loved.

Joey and I had discovered that a pair of martins were nesting in a
hollow tree near the cabin, and in order to induce other pairs to pass
the summer with us I had decided to erect a few bird houses on the
premises. I was in the Dingle one evening, therefore, in the act of
hoisting a martin house on a cedar pole, when Joey came through the
elder bushes with his inquisitive small face in a pucker.

Mrs. Olds says birds dont like bird houses, he hazarded.

Indeed? I murmured.

Do they, Mr. David?

I think so, lad.

She says she guesses phaps martins do, morn other birds. Why do
martins like bird houses specially, Mr. David?

Why, lad, I replied, straightening, and taking my pipe from between
my lips, I think it is because the Indians, long ago, before the white
mans time, made snug houses for the martins out of bark and fastened
them to their tent poles; and accordingly the martins have grown
friendly, and they like us to be hospitable and prepare a home for
them.

I dont like to have to coax them, Joey decided. Youre awful good
to things, Mr. David--sometimes when you coax me, I know Id ought to
get whipped instead.

It was the purple gloaming of an unusually sultry day; and as Joey
finished, I looked at my watch.

Bed-time, boy, I announced.

Hoo--hoo! Hoo--hoo! he called suddenly, throwing back his head. His
eyes went to the windows of the cedar room. Soon a faint answering
Hoo--hoo! resounded. He sprang up the steps, and grew hesitant
before the closed door. But in another moment it swung open and Haidee
appeared. She put her arms about the boyish visitant.

Ill kiss you on each eyelid, I heard her say. That means happy
dreams. Go to sleep and dream of Mina, Nainie, and Serena--oh, I
forgot! They are for little girls dreams. What shall I tell you to
dream of?

Praps Ill dream of Dwainies and Winnowelvers--what lives in
Spirkland--an all them things you telled me about, shall I? Joey
responded chivalrously.

I think it would be very lovely if you would, Haidees tender tones
replied. And then the kiss was given--a kiss like the drip of a drop
of dew.

I heard Joeys abashed, Good night--good night, Bell Brandon. Then
he beat a hasty crashing retreat through the underbrush, and my wonder
woman came down the steps and stood at my side.

What a glorious sky! she exclaimed. Soon therell be a trail of star
dust across that mauve vastness up yonder. I wish I might go down to
the river and see the reflections.

There was a wistful young note in her voice.

Nothing easier, I assured her. You seem quite at home on your
crutches. I think we can manage.

And so it happened that we watched the sun set together, sitting side
by side on the green plush river bank. It was a gorgeous setting, and a
more gorgeous afterglow. The meadows across the river were like a wavy
robe of pink silk. The stars crept out and floated low like skimming
butterflies. The river was amber and gold. Haidee wore the blue robe
that I found so distracting. As she talked, from time to time, she
turned her head and gazed, pensive-eyed, across the water, and I saw
the black loop of her hair, the line of cheek and throat that moved me
to such profound rapture. I sat there awkward and tongue-tied while she
told me that old Lundquist and a couple of hands from the village had
begun repairs at Hidden Lake.

I have enjoyed your hospitality, she said earnestly, but I must go
as soon as the cabin is in condition. Wanza will go with me. You are
hospitable even to the birds, she finished smilingly. I think you
must have Finnish ancestry.

My people are Southerners, I answered, scarcely thinking of my words.

How interesting. Did you live in the South?

Yes.

Oh! Shall you return some day?

I shrank from her open look. I answered, No, quietly.

Her black-tressed head dipped forward on her chest and her lips grew
mute as if my quick denial had silenced them. After a long while she
said:

What grand horizons you have in the West. I grow happier with each
sunset that I see. Look at that fleet of pinkish cloudlets--those
cloud-chariots of fire racing in those pearly streets.

The South cannot compare with the West, I said. Could any
one describe this valley? Only a poet could do it. The summers
here!--crisp, cool nights for sleep, clear bracing days for work--

And what for relaxation?

What do you think?

The twilights for relaxation, surely. The twilights--purple and
mysterious. See those weird trees that leap like twisting flames into
the sky. Look at the river, lovingly clasped in mountain arms. Listen
to the bird-twitterings. Mr. Dale, what is the bird that sings far into
the night?

The bird that says: Sweet, sweet, please hark to me, wont you?

She laughed. Something equally plaintive, at any rate.

Its the white-crowned sparrow. Youll hear it through the darkest
nights. Its song has all the sombre quality of the dark hours. Its our
American nightingale.

Mr. Audubon. You know tomes of bird lore, dont you? Joey says you
are writing a nature story. I didnt know the sparrows sang like
nightingales before.

I smiled down into the engaging face, and then I threw back my head
and whistled. I began with a rich bell-clear note, this merged into a
well defined melody, and terminated in a pealing chanson. The meadow
lark, I said, which is not a lark at all, but belongs to the oriole
family. It is an incessant singer.

Joey said you whistled like the birds. Why, youre a wonder! A
craftsman--a fixing man--and--a bird boy.

A bird in the heart is worth more than a hundred in the note book, I
quoted.

The evening ended all too soon.

Two days later Joey brought me the information that Haidee was walking
about in the Dingle with the aid of a single crutch.

An she could easily go without that, she says, Mr. David. An she
says soon she can send them to the childrens hospital in the city.

Give Bell Brandon my congratulations, I bade Joey as I rode away.

I had been to the cabin on Hidden Lake but once since the accident to
my wonder woman. I had gone there the following day to fetch Haidees
mare. Wanza had gone with me and had brought away a few essential
articles of clothing for her employer.

On my arrival I found that old Lundquist and the village hands had
cleared away the debris, and that the work of restoring the lean-to was
well under way.

I made a rough draft of the improvements Haidee and I had planned for
the cabin, and drew up some specifications for the men, and then I
strolled down to the lake. I was saying to myself that the cabin should
be tight and sound for the fall rains, and that if Haidee would allow
me I would further embellish it with a back porch and a rustic pergola
like the one I had built for Joey at Cedar Dale, when I heard a splash
in the water, a sudden swishing sound in the rushes, and saw a movement
in the tules. I sprang to the waters edge. Soon a canoe emerged from
the green thickets.

Wanza sat in the canoe, plying the paddle. A triumphant light was
on her face, her hands shone bronze in the sun, her red lips smiled
mischievously. She called to me:

Ive run away! I had to get out on the river, I just had to! Mr. Dale,
do you hear the yellow-throat singing witchery--witchery--witchery?

I straightened my shoulders with a quick uplift of spirit. Her
unexpected presence set my pulses beating a livelier measure. Her
cornflower blue eyes rested on me, then wandered to the birch thickets
along the shore, and she sat leaning slightly forward, her gaze remote,
a charming figure in the sunlight.

Would you like to hear me recite my little piece about the
yellow-throat?

  While May bedecks the naked trees
  With tassels and embroideries,
  And many blue-eyed violets beam
  Along the edges of the stream,
  I hear a voice that seems to say,
  Now near at hand, now far away,
  Witchery--witchery--witchery.

Her glance came back to me.

I wish, Mr. Dale, that we had blue violets in these woods--they all
seem to be yellow. Why do you stare at me so?

I had no idea you were coming; it is a stare of surprise.

But youre glad to see me, now, arent you? Ill paddle you home.
Hows the cabin getting on?

It is scarcely habitable yet. But I think the men are getting on as
well as could be expected.

Her face was dappled with light and shadow as she sat there. An
exquisite, happy radiance emanated from her. She looked inquiringly
into my eyes and swept her paddle.

You _are_ surprised to see me, you sure are! But now that I am here I
want to see the improvements. Give me your hand, David Dale.

She beached her canoe, stood up, and placed her hand on my shoulder
as I bent to her. Very lightly I passed my arm about her. She flashed
a laughing side glance at me, and put one foot over the side of the
craft. I dont need that much help, she said, grimacing.

The canoe rocked, suddenly. She stumbled. I caught her. She was against
my breast. You see you needed that much help, I laughed boyishly.

Let me go, Mr. David Dale.

She shook herself free and stood apart from me. The sunlight slanted on
her face as she stood there, flushing wildly, gilded her white neck,
flashed on her bare arms. She held her head down for a moment, and then
she raised it and looked at me. Her eyes were soft and wet. What a
goose I was, she cried softly. Come on, Ill race you to the cabin!

I paddled home in the canoe with Wanza, after directing Lundquist
to ride my horse back to Cedar Dale. The river purred to us all the
way, the meadow larks and warblers chanted roundelays of joy and love
from the thickets, and the birch trees shook their silver, tinkling
leaves in elfish music above the sun-kissed water. We were very
silent drifting down the river, and my thoughts were strange, strange
thoughts. I had begun to wonder about Wanza--Wanza, who understood my
rapture at the sight of the new day, who felt the same tightening of
the throat at the song of the birds, the same breathlessness beneath
the stars. I had begun to ask myself if, after all, she were not as
fine as another, even though through long association her rareness for
me was impaired.




CHAPTER XVI

WE HAVE AN ADVENTURE


ABOUT this time I began to hear strange stories in the village of
a silver-tip bear that was committing grave depredations in the
community. I recounted exploits of grizzlies to Haidee and Wanza as we
sat in the Dingle now and then, smiling at Haidees delicate shiver of
horror, and glorying in Wanzas bravado which led her into all sorts of
bombastic declarations as to what her line of conduct would be should
she meet Mr. Silvertip face to face.

Of course, she was fond of repeating, if I was carrying a gun I
would shoot him.

Joey kept me awake long after we both should have been soundly sleeping
to tell me how he would meet the bear in the woods some fine day when
alone, and summarily dispose of him with the twenty-two calibre rifle
he called his own, but which needless to say, he had never been allowed
to use much. We were all pleasantly excited anent the grizzly.

I feel sure that it will be my happy fortune to fire the shot that
will bring to an inglorious end old big foots career, I said
dramatically one morning.

We had foregathered in the Dingle--Haidees mare, Buttons, and
Wanzas Rosebud were neighing just beyond in the pine thicket--for we
were going to ride. Some days since we had taken our first jaunt on
horseback, and Haidee had found that the excursion wearied her not at
all. The crutches were infrequently used now. Haidee explained that
her continued use of them was simply a manifestation of fear-thought.
I little meant the words I said, but when we rode away I carried my
thirty-thirty slung on my shoulder.

As we went through the village we met Captain Grif Lyttle mounted on
his piebald broncho. It required no little urging to induce him to join
our expedition. But eventually he was won over.

If it was goin to ride only, Id be for it. But I see youre toting
your dinner. I dont hold with picnics. This carryin grub a few
miles--an there be _nothin_ heavier than grub--settin down and
eatin it, and beatin it back home, is all tomfoolishness, pears to
me. But you young folks sees things different; and if so be Ill be
any acquisition whatsoever to your party, I stand ready to go along.
He looked hard at Haidee as he spoke, and I was half prepared for the
remark he addressed to her: Pears to me, young lady, you aint got up
for a picnic, exactly. That there gauzy waistll snag on the bushes,
and your armsll burn to a blister--theres no protection in such
sleazy stuff. Look at Wanza now--shes rigged up proper!--stout skirt
and high shoes and a right thick waist.

We had gone some distance before I noticed that Wanza was carrying my
twenty-two. I was not over civil when I saw it in her hands.

I like to shoot things, she explained, with a deprecatory glance.

Captain Grif chuckled.

Wanza do be the beatenest gal with a gun, if I do say it, he remarked.

The glance he leveled at his daughter was pleased and proud; and there
was a depth of affection in it that was touching.

Well, Wanza repeated lightly, I sure do like to shoot things.

Things!--squirrels, rabbits, birds--what? I winked at Captain Grif.

You know me better than that! she stormed.

What then?

Well--the bear, if I meet him alone.

With a twenty-two!

[Illustration: A SUDDEN YEARNING SPRANG UP]

I turned my back on her and spurred forward to Haidees side. Haidee
sat her mount superbly. She wore the blue riding skirt and white blouse
she had worn on the occasion of her first visit to Cedar Dale. She
was hatless. Her hair was loosely braided. She swayed lightly in her
saddle. There was something bonny, almost insouciant in her bearing
this morning. Wanza rode beside her father with Joey on the saddle
before her, and they lagged behind Haidee and me persistently, stopping
so often that once or twice we lost sight of them completely when
the road curved or we dipped down into a hollow. Whenever I glanced
around at Wanza I saw her riding with her face upturned to the trees,
a detached look on her face. Once I heard her whistle to a bluebird
and once I heard her sing. The pathos of her song clutched me by the
throat. In the midst of a speech to Haidee I stopped short. In my
heart a sudden yearning sprang up, a yearning only half understood; I
longed to help, to lift Wanza--to make her more like the woman at my
side--more finished, less elemental. In spite of my wonder and worship
of Haidee the pathos of Wanzas simple, ignorant life stirred me--yes,
and hurt me!

Nevertheless I was still facetious to Wanza when we dismounted beneath
the shade of some giant pines at noon. She winced as she unslung the
rifle from her shoulder, and I said teasingly:

I thought youd feel the weight of that by noon.

Haidee murmured: You poor thing! Why did you insist on bringing it?

I looked across at her sharply. Something in her manner of speaking
caused me to say chivalrously: Wanza is welcome to the rifle--it isnt
that.

With a quick glance from one to the other Wanza turned to the saddle
bags and began with Joeys help, to unpack mysterious looking bundles.
I gathered dry twigs, built a fire between two flat rocks, and went to
a distant spring for water. Then, a half hour later, the blue smoke
from our fire drifted away among the pines, and the wind bore the
mingled odors of coffee and sizzling bacon. We sat in a group around
the red tablecloth Wanza spread on the ground. Captain Grif ate but
little, but he discoursed at large.

We finished our meal, and lay back on the grass, and saw the sky, blue
above the dark tapestry of the forest. From reclining I dropped flat
on my back and lay staring up through the chinks in the green roof,
while Haidee read Omar aloud, Wanza threw pine cones at the chipmunks,
Captain Grif snoozed, and Joey took his bow-gun and went off on a still
hunt for Indians.

An hour passed. When Haidee ceased reading Wanza sighed and said:

Why didnt we eat our lunch closer to the spring, Id like to know.
Ill need more water to wash the forks and spoons before we go.

I rose with a resigned air. I will go to the spring, I said, taking
the small tin pail that had been used as a coffee boiler. But
understand we are to have another hour of Omar before we go--this is an
intermission merely.

The captain opened one eye, and half closing his big hand made an
ineffectual attempt to scoop a fly into his palm.

I low I dont understand that fellow Omar--he dont sound lucid to
me, he complained. I dont know as I relish bein called a Bubble,
exactly, either. He settled back more comfortably. But he was a
philosopher, and Im a philosopher, so I admire him, and Ill stand
by him. All them old chaps was all right ceptin the lubber that
poured treacle on himself to attract the ants--he was sure peculiar!
Get away there, you fly! Golly, s-ship-mate, _flies_ is bad enough, but
_ants_!--

I made quick work of reaching the spring in spite of the dense
underbrush that impeded my steps. But once there I became enamored
of a reddish-yellow butterfly--Laura, of the genus Argynnis--and I
followed it into a hawthorn thicket, through the thicket to a tangle
of moss-festooned birches, and eventually lost the specimen in a
dense growth of bramble. I went back to the spring, filled my pail
and was stooping to drink when I thought I heard a shot. I could not
be certain, as the noise of the water running over a rock bed filled
my ears. But I had gone only a few yards from the spring and out into
a clearing when I heard unmistakably a shot from my thirty-thirty. I
dropped the pail and ran.

When I came to the pine grove where I had left Haidee and Wanza and
the captain, I saw a strange sight. Wanza, white-faced and apparently
unconscious, lay in a huddled heap on the ground, the twenty-two at
her side; Haidee bent over her; the captain stood, wild-eyed, holding
my thirty-thirty in his hand; and near them a silver-tip lay bleeding
from a wound in his heart. Even as I went forward to ascertain that the
bear had received his quietus, I spoke to the captain.

Good work, Captain Grif.

When I saw that the bear had been dispatched, I ran back to Wanzas
side. The captain had lifted her in his arms, her head was against his
breast. The color was coming back to her face.

Dont try to shoot a bear again with a twenty-two, Wanza, I said, as
she unclosed her eyes. She looked at me strangely and shuddered. Some
one had to shoot quick, and I had the twenty-two in my hand. I would
have said more, but Joey crept out of the bushes, looked at the bear,
then at me, and said:

Lets go home, Mr. David.

When I was preparing Joey for bed that night, he piped out suddenly: I
saw Wanza shoot the bear.

Wanza? I turned on him.

Yep! Sure. I was in the bushes playing Indian. The bear came out
of the huckleberry bushes in the draw, rolling his head awful. Bell
Brandon she screamed. Whew, she grabbed Wanza, she did! Captain Grif
woke up, and got only on to his knees--he wobbled so!--and then Wanza
up with the twenty-two and shot--just like that! And then she grabbed
the big gun and shot again. Then her father he took the gun away from
her, and Wanza just fell down on the ground. And then you came.

That same evening I said to Wanza:

I was very stupid not to understand that you shot first with the
twenty-two, and then dispatched the bear with the thirty-thirty. I
thought your father killed the bear. Why did you not tell me?

It didnt make any difference as I could see who killed the bear. The
main thing was to kill it, was the reply I received.

The next day Wanza informed me that Mrs. Olds patient was able to sit
up in bed. Ive been talking to him, she added, with a flirt of her
head. If I was a good reader, now, Id be glad to read to him a bit.

I think you are doing very well as you are, Wanza, I replied.

There surged through me the instinctive dislike, almost aversion, I had
felt on the night of his coming to Cedar Dale, and my tone was stern.

He wants me to talk to him though, he says. He says he needs perking
up. My, he knows a lot, dont he, Mr. Dale? Seems like he knows
everything, most. And I do think hes handsome. Hes got the finest
eyes! Though theres something odd about them, too, if you stop to
think. The worst with handsome eyes is that you _dont_ stop to think!
Im going out now to get some hardhack for him. He says he dont
remember ever seeing the pink kind. What do you call it, Mr. Dale?

Spiraea tomentosa. Wait a bit, Wanza, I said, Ill go with you.

We went to the woods. It was morning, and the freshness of the hour
was incomparable. The birds were singing with a sort of rapture. And
our way through the silent greenwood aisles was wholesome and sweet
with the breath of pine and balm o Gilead. The vistas were rosy with
pink hardhack; on either side feathery white clusters of wild clematis
festooned the thickets, and here and there the bright faces of roses
peeped out at us from tangles of undergrowth.

I know not what spirit of willfulness possessed Wanza. I think she had
it in her mind to arouse my jealousy by praise of the big man. Her talk
was all of him. Finally I had my say.

I know nothing of him, Wanza. He may be a splendid chap, of course,
and he may be a rascal. Frankly, I do not like him. Admire him, if you
want to. But I would rather you did not chat with him unless Mrs. Olds
is present.

Dear me! How can a little friendly chat hurt any one.

Wanza tucked a wild rose into her curls, and it hung pendent, nodding
at me saucily, as she tossed her head and laughed in my face. Her
cheeks matched the flower in color. I looked at her admiringly, but my
voice was still firm as I said: I hope you will be careful to give
very little of your time to Mrs. Olds patient.

Ha, ha, laughed Wanza, crinkling her eyelids and giving me an elfish
glance from beneath tawny lashes.

In a measure, I continued, you are in my care, and I feel
responsible for your associates while you are with me.

Well, drawled Wanza, if Im with an angel most all day and all the
night--meaning Mrs. Batterly--it sure wont hurt me to talk some to
a sinner like the big man. Besides, itll help out a lot. Itll keep
me from getting glum, Mr. Dale. She favored me with another roguish
glance. You wouldnt have me getting glum, would you?

I wish the big man were well, and on his way, so that we might use
the front room again. Mrs. Batterly has only her room and the Dingle
as it is, and she must grow tired of having her meals in her room, I
complained.

I carried her breakfast to her this morning in the Dingle. There was
something defiant in the girls tone.

Famous! I cried.

After a short silence Wanza said provokingly:

If I want to talk to the big man and Mrs. Olds is out of ear shot I
dont see as it can matter.

Please, Wanza, I insisted, talk with him as little as possible.

Her eyes were laughing, and teasing and pacifying all at one and the
same time. I held out my hand.

Say you will do as I ask, and give me your hand on it, I implored.

Her eyes were only teasing now. She shook her head, and I dropped my
hand and turned away. I heard a rustling among the grasses and thought
she had gone. But when after taking a few steps I looked around, there
she was, perched on a boulder, her feet drawn up beneath her pink
gingham skirt, her arms crossed on her breast, her eyes surveying me
steadfastly. I did not smile as I faced her. I merely glanced and swung
on my heel.

Come here, she called.

When I was close beside her again she shook her head more vehemently
than before, until all her tiny tight curls bobbed up and down
distractingly.

It wont do, she said.

What wont do? I asked.

Your trying to boss me wont do, my trying to pretend wont do.

What are you trying to pretend, Wanza?

That Im crazy about the big man. I aint.

Oh? Well, I really would have no right to object if you found him
attractive. I dare say I have seemed rather dictatorial, I answered
chivalrously.

And something else wont do.

Pray tell me what it is.

It wont do for you to pretend, either.

I? What do I pretend?

She eyed me gravely, pulled a blade of grass, blew on it, and cast it
aside.

Lot of things, she said then.

Do I, Wanza?

But I can stand anything--anything, she threw out both hands, except
being bossed. I cant stand that.

No one could, I agreed.

And you mustnt try it on, because if you do!--me and you will part
company.

I was surprised at the hard glint in her eyes, the inflexible tone of
her voice. Her face was quite unlovely at that moment.

Child, child, I began impulsively, but I hesitated and said nothing
more, for her eyes with their strange hardness seemed the eyes of a
stranger.

The crisp, blue morning paved the way to a hot, still day. I drove to
the village for supplies in the afternoon, and after supper I was glad
to rest on the river bank, with Joey sprawling on the grass at my side.
The moon rose early and climbed into the purple pavilion above us,
spraying the world with a wash of gold. The night became serene, almost
solemn; one big, bright star burst upon our sight from the top of a
low ridge of hills opposite, and threw a linked, sliding silver bridge
from one plush river bank to the other. It looked like some strange
aerial craft fired with unearthly splendor, and propelled by unguessed
sorcery. I was glad to forget the tawdry, painted day that was slipping
into the arms of night. It had been a fretting day in many particulars.
My morning with Wanza had irked me, I had had almost no conversation
with Haidee, and Mrs. Olds had been exceedingly arbitrary during the
evening meal in the hot, stuffy little kitchen. The calm evening hour
was like a benediction to me, and Joeys tender little hand stroking
mine soothed me inexpressibly.

I was hoping to escape without the usual sleep-time story, but one
glance at the eager face showed me that the lad was eagerly expecting
its spinning. And his first words were evidently meant to act as an
impetus.

If you was to tell me a story, Mr. David, would it be a fairy one, do
you think? Or would it be about a bear, do you spose, or a--a tiger?

I am afraid I spoke rather impatiently.

Arent you tired of bears and tigers yet, Joey?

A wistful voice replied:

Did you get tired of em when you was little, Mr. David?

No, no, I answered hastily, of course, I did not.

The lad rolled over until his brown head rested against my knee.

To-night Id liever hear about fairies.

Honestly, Joey?

Yep! Criss cross my heart and hope to die. I like to hear about
Dwainies.

Who calls them Dwainies?

Her--Bell Brandon.

The dear homey name! I smiled down into the boys brown eyes. Suddenly
it seemed to me that I should enjoy a talk about Dwainies.

Well, I began, I shall tell you a story of a Dwainie called
Arethusa. Say it after me, Joey. Arethusa.

Arethusa, he repeated painstakingly.

Arethusa was a nymph. She lived in a place called Arcadia. And
she slept on a couch of snow in the Acroceraunian mountains. Dont
interrupt, please, Joey!--

I was only trying to say that big word--its hard enough to say the
name of our own mountains--but Ac--Acro--

Never mind. It is not necessary for you to remember all the names in
my stories, only the names I ask you to remember.

Bell Brandon says youre teaching me funny that way. She says youre
teaching me stories of the old world before you teach me to speak good
English. Whats good English, Mr. David?

Never mind, lad, I murmured confusedly. My wonder woman was quite
right, Joeys English was reprehensible; but I confess I secretly
enjoyed it--there was something eminently Joeyish about it--a
quaintness that I found irresistible. I smiled, and sighed, and
continued, Arethusas hair was rainbow colored, and her eyes were
sky blue, and her cheeks coral. Gliding and springing she went, ever
singing; you see, she was not only beautiful, but light hearted and
pure. The Earth loved her, and the Heaven smiled above her. Now Alpheus
was a river-god. He sat very often on a glacier--a cold, cold glacier,
and whenever he struck the mountains with his trident great chasms
would open, and the whole world about would shake. He saw the Dwainie
Arethusa, one day, and as she ran he followed the fleet nymphs flight
to the brink of the Dorian sea.

Oh, oh, breathed my listener, eyes distended, and lips apart. Did he
catch her?

He followed her to the brink--the edge, Joey--of the sea. Arethusa
cried: Oh, save me! Oh, guide me! And bid the deep hide me, for he
grasps me now by the hair--

Her rainbow hair?

Yes, yes,--dont interrupt.

Who did she yell to?

The loud Ocean heard. It stirred, and divided--parted, boy--and under
the water the Earths white daughter fled like a sunny beam.

Hm! What did the river-god do then?

He pursued her. He descended after her. Like a gloomy stain on the
emerald main.

But did he get her, Mr. David?

Well, Arethusa was changed into a stream by Diana, and the stream
was turned into a fountain in the island of Ortygia, and Alpheus
the river-god still pursuing her, finally won her, and they dwelt
single-hearted in the fountains of Ennas mountains.

There was a burst of roguish laughter behind me.

What a classic tale for a child mind, a light voice cried.

Haidee stood among the shadows of the cottonwoods, swaying between her
crutches.

Mrs. Olds has sent me in search of you. The canteen you soldered for
her patients use has come unsoldered, the tin lining of the fireless
cooker has sprung a leak, the big man has to be lifted while his bed
is being changed, and she wants to know if you forgot to purchase the
malted milk this afternoon--she cant find it anywhere. She said, too,
that you had signified your intention of rubbing soap on the doors to
prevent their squeaking. She also said something about procrastination,
but it sounded hackneyed--quite as if I had heard it somewhere
before--so I left rather precipitately.

All the while I was soldering the canteen for the big mans feet, I
could hear Wanza chattering blithely with the patient in the front
room. She came out to me after awhile, and stood at my elbow as I
examined the cooker. I frowned at her, and received a moue in return.

Ive been telling the big man about my peddlers cart, she ventured
finally. Hes so set on seeing it, soon as hes well enough! Seems he
never saw one. He cant talk much, hes that weak yet--like a baby! But
I can talk to him.

I shall not ask you not to talk with him, again, Wanza, I announced.

Its just as well, seeing as I know what Im about. Land! the poor
man! He needs some one to talk to him. I dont notice you hurting
yourself seeing after him, Mr. David Dale!

I felt very weary and intolerably disgusted with everything, and I
answered sharply, Thats my own affair. The next minute I saw the
blood spurt from my palm, and realized even as Wanza cried out that I
had cut myself rather badly on the tin lining of the cooker. I turned
faint and dizzy, and opening the door I plunged out into the night air
followed closely by Wanza.

Its nothing, I kept saying, keeping my hand behind me as she would
have examined it.

Please--please, Mr. Dale, let me look at it.

She pressed forward to my side and reached around behind me for my
hand. I could feel her quivering in every limb.

Its nothing, I maintained, though the pain was intense, and the
rapid flow of blood was weakening me.

It is something. Oh, if only to be kind to me, Mr. Dale, let me have
your hand!

We struggled, my other arm went around her, and I attempted to draw
her back and sweep her around to my uninjured side. I was obstinate
and angry, and she was persistent and tearful, and we wrestled like
two foolish children. Please, please, she kept repeating, and I
reiterated, No. It must have looked uncommonly like a love scene to a
casual onlooker, and Haidees voice speaking through the dusk gave me
an odd thrill.

I have called and called you, Wanza, she was saying. Will you go
to Mrs. Olds, please? I think she wants water from the spring, or the
malted milk prepared, or--or something equally trivial.

I released my prisoner and she sped away. I was left to peer through
the darkness at Haidee and vainly conjure my mind for something to say.
The drip, drip of the blood from my cut on to the maple leaves at my
feet, gave me a disagreeable sensation. I felt weakened, and slow in
every pulse. I thought of words, but had no will to voice them, and
so I stood staring stupidly at the vision before me. She spoke with a
strange little gasp in her voice at last.

I think I have been mistaken in you, Mr. Dale.

You are making a mistake now, I replied hoarsely. There was a
peculiar singing in my ears, and a buzzing in my brain where small
wheels seemed to be grinding round, so that my tone was not convincing,
and as I spoke I leaned my shoulder against a tree from sheer weakness.
In my own ears my words sounded shallow and ineffectual. I tried to
speak again but succeeded in making only a clicking sound in my throat.
I felt myself slipping weakly lower and lower, though I dug my feet
into the turf and braced my knees heroically. Faster and faster the
wheels went round. I felt that Haidee was moving toward the cabin away
from me. I tried to call her name. But I was floundering in a quagmire
of unreality; I groped in a dubious morass darkly, straining toward
the light. My knees felt like pulp, they yielded completely and I slid
ignominiously to the ground, rolled over, and lay inert, waves of
darkness washing over me.

It was Joey who found me, whose tears on my face aroused me. His grief
was wild. His lamentations echoed around me. He was moaning forth: Mr.
David, Mr. David, in a frenzy, laying his face on mine, patting my
cheeks, lifting my eyelids with trembling fingers. Are you killed? Are
you killed? I heard him wail. Oh dear, dear, my own Mr. David, please
open your eyes and speak to Joey!

A light from a lantern struck blindingly into my eyes as I unclosed
them and I quickly lowered my lids. But my lad had seen the sign of
life and I heard him call: Wanza, Wanza, come quick! Mr. David is
laying here all bloody and hurted.

I struggled to a sitting posture as Wanza came forward at a run,
swinging her lantern. A few minutes later I sat on a bench in the
workshop while Wanza bathed and dressed my hand and gave me a sip
of brandy from a bottle she found in the cupboard over one of the
small windows. I was ashamed of my weakness and I apologized for it,
explaining that I had never been able to endure the sight of blood with
fortitude, and admitting that the tin had cut rather deep.

Now you just crawl into bed and go to sleep and forget all about it,
she crooned, mothering me, with a gentle hand on my hair. She went
to my bunk in the corner, shook up the pillows and straightened the
blankets, and catching up the pail of water filled the basin on the
wash-bench. Wash your face and hands, you Joe, she ordered. Then
come outside and Ill hear you say your prayers.

I was lying in my bunk half asleep, though tortured by the remembrance
of Haidees words, when I heard the following oddly disjointed prayer
from the river bank.

Now I lay me--Oh, God, thank you for not letting Mr. David bleed to
death--I pray the Lord--Cause if he had bled to death Id want to die
too--my soul to keep--hes all I got, and I want to thank you for him,
God-- Wait, Wanza, this is a new prayer Im saying! I am going to ask
God to bless you, too. Bless Wanza, please, God,--but bless Mr. David
the most,--oh, the most of anybody in the whole world! Amen.

Soon Joey came pattering in to the shop and very gingerly crawled in
beside me. He was asleep, and I was lying miserably brooding, when
Wanza called softly just outside the window: Mr. Dale--hoo-hoo!

Yes, Wanza? I answered.

Ive been to the cabin--in the cedar room--talking with Mrs. Batterly.
I told her all about your cutting your hand, and--and how you would not
let me look at it--and how silly I was, trying to make you--when she
come up. I told her how I found you on the ground--and--and everything.
Go to sleep now.

I shall, Wanza. Thank you, I cried gratefully.




CHAPTER XVII

THE DREAM IN THE DINGLE


A FEW days later I was summoned to the big mans side as he sat, fully
dressed for the first time, outside the cabin in the shade of a cedar.
I sat beside him while he thanked me for my hospitality, and said it
was his intention to push on to Roselake and thence to Wallace that
very afternoon.

I have business to transact there for my partner, Dick Bailey, who
died in Alaska last winter, he said, and stopped short, looking at me
with a sudden question in his eyes. By the bye, you people seem to be
laboring under the impression that my name is Bailey, he added.

Mrs. Olds found the name on a pocketbook you carried, I explained.

To be sure--I was carrying an old wallet of Baileys. Our initials are
the same, too. He fell to musing, wrinkling his brows. But instead
of telling me his name, he went on presently: You are master of a
somewhat unusual household, Dale. I am vastly interested. Youre a
lucky dog to have such a Hebe for a protge as the girl Wanza, such
an infant prodigy as that young scamp, who shows fine discrimination,
and glowers at me from the kitchen door, for an adopted son,--and who
is the interesting lady patient on whom Wanza waits and who is shut up
in a Blue Beards closet next my room? I have a sly sure instinct that
tells me she is the most wonderful of the lot.

The blood rushed to my face. The leer with which he accompanied his
words was rakish, and his handsome face smirked disgustingly.

She is an unfortunate neighbor of mine, who was crippled by a falling
tree the night of the storm, I answered coldly.

He gave me a quizzical glance, shrugged his shoulders, and exclaimed
laughingly:

Beauty in distress! Don Quixote to the rescue. Youre the sort of
chap, I fancy, Dale, who goes about tilting at windmills. You belong to
a past generation. But it is lucky for me I stumbled across you. Well,
I care not to pry into your Blue Beards closet--the girl Wanza is a
piquant enough little devil for me--

Just speak more respectfully of her, if you must speak at all, I
interrupted with heat.

Don Quixote, Don Quixote, he murmured, wagging a broad finger at me,
and shaking his head playfully.

I said something beneath my breath, and rose from my chair hastily.

Wait! Wait! he cried. Dont let your choler rise. Sit down. We will
not discuss the ladies. I was about to tell you my name, and give you
my credentials--

He broke off abruptly. Joey was issuing from the elder bushes piping
on his flute. As I listened, a voice from the Dingle caught up the
refrain, a voice high and sweet and clear.

  Bell Brandon was the birdling of the mountains--

The line ended in a ripple of laughter. The man before me half raised
in his seat. Then sweeter and lower:

  And I loved the little beauty, Bell Brandon--
  And she sleeps neath the old arbor tree.

The underbrush parted and Haidee came toward us, leaning slightly on
one crutch. In her hand she carried a great bunch of pink spirea. Each
cheek was delicately brushed with color, her star-eyes were agleam, her
lips curved with laughter.

And then, all suddenly, the dimples and laughter and life fled from her
beautiful face, her eyes turned dull and anguished. She was looking
at the big man, and he was looking at her. His pasty face was gray as
ashes. His little eyes contracted to pin-points.

Haidees dry lips writhed apart. One word dropped from them:

You!

She crouched forward, peered at him intently through the soft green
shadows of the cedars, her eyes growing bigger as if wild with a sudden
hope that they might have played her a trick. And then gradually the
intentness left them, they hardened, and her whole face stiffened, and
grew white and grim.

The big man had risen. He took a step forward now. There was something
bullying in his attitude, something implacable in his altered face. His
light eyes had a sinister gleam, but his _savoir-faire_ did not desert
him. He spoke to me, but his eyes never left the marble face of the
woman who confronted him.

Mr. Dale, he said with a wave of the hand, pardon our agitation. I
am Randall Batterly. This is the first time my wife and I have met in
five years.

I reached Haidees side just in time, for the crutch slipped from her
grasp, and she would have fallen but for my steadying arm.

Joey, the dauntless, sprang forward and menaced the big man with
threatening, childish fist. You leave my Bell Brandon alone! he
screamed, you leave her alone--you big, bad man! I wish wed let you
die, I do.

I placed Haidee in a chair. I took Joeys hand and led him indoors. I
heard a wild cry ring out:

I thought you were dead in the Yukon, Randall Batterly, I thought you
were dead. I hate you! I hate you!

I closed the door on her agonized weeping.

Before the big man left that day he sent Wanza to ask me to come to him
in the living room. I was in my workshop, and I shook my head when the
message was delivered. In the mood I was in then it was well for me not
to go to him. I shall never forget the expression on Mrs. Olds face
when she sought me in the shop a half hour later to bid me good-bye.
She had found, at last, food for her prying, suspicious mind.

I am that shocked and surprised, Mr. Dale! she gasped, all of a
flutter. Why, Im just trembly! I heard high voices, and I stole
out on the porch, and there they were, saying such dreadful, dreadful
things to each other! And isnt it odd, Mr. Dale, that they should come
together here in this remote--I was going to say God forsaken--spot,
this way? Now, dont you suppose they will patch up their differences?
I should think they might--theyre young folks--it seems a pity
the amount of domestic infelicity nowadays--and they are a likely
fine looking couple. She drew breath, shook her head, and paused
dramatically.

I felt her fish-eyes searching my face.

Then she broke out, as I maintained an apparently unruffled front:

Of course, Mr. Dale, it is not for me to say all I think--not for
me to say whose is the fault. But I must say I am surprised and
disappointed--yes, and shocked--shocked, Mr. Dale, that Mrs. Batterly,
a married woman, should proclaim herself a widow. When a woman will do
that--why, what is one to think! I cant abide duplicity. To my notion
there is absolutely no excuse for that, Mr. Dale. And if she did not
know her husband was alive--well, I have no words.

I was sullen-hearted enough, God knows, and Mrs. Olds inane, arrogant
drivel was like tinder on a blown fire. I was wild as an enraged bull
who has the red scarf flaunted in his long suffering face. I thrust out
my chin and I squared my shoulders, and I know my face must have grown
ugly with my red-eyed anger.

If I had spoken then, I am sure Mrs. Olds could have guessed most
accurately at the state of my heart with regard to Haidee. But just at
that moment the cedar waxwing left its cage, circled about my head,
and descended to settle in the crook of my arm. I straightened my arm,
and it hopped to my outspread palm, looking up at me with pert, bright
eyes. In that short space during which the bird poised there, I thought
of a hundred poignant things to say to Mrs. Olds. But the bird flew
away and I said not one of them.

After I had bidden good-bye to Mrs. Olds there was Wanza still to be
reckoned with. I had just seen from my window the flurried departure
of the nurse and her patient on the afternoon stage when I heard a
tentative voice at my elbow, murmur: Mr. Dale.

I am sure there must have been a certain fierceness in my bearing as I
wheeled about. But I was all unprepared for the fervid face that my
lips almost brushed as I turned, the depth of emotion in the burningly
blue eyes.

Dont! she breathed, as I faced her. Dont, please!

Dont what, child? I articulated.

Dont look at me so sharp--so awful! Her voice thinned, as if she
were going to cry. Her brown, pleading hands came out to me. I only
want to say good-bye.

As I still stood woodenly, looking at her, she moved back with a swift
jerk of her slim body and put her hands behind her. Her face altered.
It whitened, and she let her lids droop over eyes suddenly hot with
resentment. Feeling like a brute I made haste to intercept the hands.
I slipped my arms about her, caught the hands, and drew them around
against my chest. I think I had never liked Wanza better than at that
moment in her hurt pride, and womanliness.

Dear Wanza, I said, my dear child--

She pressed against me suddenly, and put her soft cheek against my
sleeve.

What is it, child, what is it? I begged. I put my hand gently on her
hair.

Im going away, Mr. Dale--Im going! I been so happy here--with you
and Joey and the birds.

Her breaths were sobs.

It was my turn to say Dont! I said it imploringly, and I added: I
cannot bear to see you cry, Wanza.

Oh, let me cry! Im upset, and nervous, and--and sad--I guess youd
call it. Im going on home now, and set things to rights a bit, and
to-night Im going to Hidden Lake to stay with Mrs. Batterly. I
promised.

She needs you, Wanza, I said.

I was to ask you if you would ride through the woods with her, in a
half hour. Shes not quite fit to go alone, Mr. Dale. Suddenly Wanza
broke into a tempest of tears, and sobbed and shook, huddled against
my shoulder, stammering: Everything is upside down--upside down!
But--yes, Mr. Dale, I am glad--glad--that Mrs. Batterly has got a
husband living. Hes probably a bad man, and if she wanted to run away
it was all right and nobodys business. But it had to come out that
she had a husband, and Im glad its come--thats all! Im glad its
come--now--afore--

I looked down at the opulent fleece of hair spinning into artless
spirals of maze against my shoulder, and I threaded a curl through my
fingers absently before I probed this significant, stumbling final
sentence. Then I caught at the lost word. Before, Wanza? Before--what!

Before you got to thinking too much of her.

I laughed. I stood away from the child and laughed ironically. The
laugh saved the situation. Wanza raised her head, gave a watery smile,
and flung out.

You neednt laugh. You were thinking too much of her--you know you
was.

Please, Wanza,--dont!

Now your face is black again. Wanzas mood changed swiftly. Oh, Mr.
Dale, I have a weight here, she laid her hand on her chest. I feel
things pressing,--awful things! Whats going to happen, do you think,
that I feel so queer and blue and bad?

I shook my head. She went on quickly:

Of course Im broke up about leaving Cedar Dale just now, I just cant
bear to quit you and Joey--and the birds--and squirrels--and flowers--

The tears were brimming up again in the velvet-blue eyes. I walked over
to the waxwings cage, snapped shut the door on the tiny prisoner, and
handed the cage to Wanza.

Take him with you, I bade her.

With the cage clasped in her arms, her eyes flooded with tears, but
with smiles on her mobile lips, she went from the shop, backward, step
by step.

After Wanza came Joey. A transfigured Joey. Wild with rage at the big
man, threatening, and bombastic. Then softening into plaintive grief,
wailing:

Oh, Mr. David, my Bell Brandons going! Shes going! She wont be here
to-night for my sleep-time story. She wont be here when I wake up
to-morrow. She wont ever stay here again.

No, lad, I replied.

Wont she, dont you spose? Praps if she dont like it at Hidden
Lake shell come back. Dont you think shell come again, Mr. David?

No, I repeated, sadly.

He sniffled. Then he said, in a frightened tone, Wanza aint going
too, is she?

Yes, Joey.

He drew his sleeve across his eyes. He swallowed. Then he said, winking
hard, Ill miss Bell Brandon, but Ill miss Wanza most.

After a moment, I ventured:

You have me, Joey.

He drew his sleeve across his eyes again, gulped, and muttered:

Im shamed. I love you most! But shes mothery--Wanza is, thats it!

Mothery--Wanza of the winds will--mothery!

I keep a picture still in my mind of that last day on which I rode
through the forest with Haidee to Hidden Lake. Rain had drenched the
earth the previous night, and though the sun smiled from a cloudless
sky, the roads were heavy and our horses progress slow. There was a
languid drowsiness in the air, enhanced by the low, incessant singing
of cat-bird, robin and lark, and the overpowering scent of syringa
and rose. We chose a shadowy trail, and our heads were brushed by
white-armed flowery hawthorns, while honeysuckle threw fragrant
tendrils across our way. The woods glowed emerald-green, and dappled
gray, gemmed here and there with dogwood; great plumes of spirea rose
like pink clouds in the purple vistas. Small hollows held crystal-clear
water, and up from these hollows floated swarms of azure butterflies.
We crossed a swift-running stream; and before us, between smooth, mossy
banks fern-topped, lay a cup-like dell, shut in by shrubs and vines. I
drew rein, and dismounted, and Haidee with a swift glance at my face
drew in her mare.

I went to her side.

She held some purple flowers in the bend of her arm, flowers that Joey
had given her, she fingered the petals with a caressing touch. Her
head drooped slightly, but her eyes met mine questioningly. The pallor
of her face but made it more exquisite. Her gown was gray. Its folds
rippled about her slight form. She seemed like some grave-eyed spirit.
Her hair was in braids, outlining the ivory of her face. A scarf of
white muslin left her warm throat bare.

I strove for words. But I could only whisper:

I am your friend. Never forget. If danger ever threatens you--

If danger ever threatened me, I believe that you would intervene--you
are a brave man, David Dale. But I shall live safely--going on with
my even life--in my little cabin, with good Wanza for a companion. I
have had a shock, Mr. Dale, her voice quivered, her lips whitened with
the words, oh, such a shock! It is better not to speak of it. Not at
least unless I tell you all there is to tell, and I am not ready as
yet to do that. She struggled with herself. She drew a deep breath.
But I came here to work! I shall work as I have planned until autumn,
then--well, I do not know what then. You heard much yesterday--you
know my attitude toward the man who is my husband. I dare say you are
shocked, and shaken in your chivalrous estimate of me. I cannot help
that. I do not feel that I can explain--it goes too deep. It is not to
be laid bare before--forgive me--a stranger.

She smiled at me sadly as if to soften the last words. But hurt and
amazed, I cried:

A stranger! Am I that?

A light sprang into her eyes, the red came into her cheeks.

Forgive me, she said again.

I am your friend--your true friend--no stranger. I held out my hand.
I thought you understood.

She kept her eyes upon me, but did not seem to see me. They were
hunted, weary eyes; weary to indifference, I saw suddenly. And seeing
this I took her slim fingers in mine and pressed them very gently and
let them go.

Suddenly her composure broke. She turned whiter, she could scarcely
breathe. She moved her head restlessly. I cant bear it--I cant--I
cant! I wish I might fly to the ends of the earth--but theres no
escape. She brushed her hand across her face. She cowered in her
saddle. Its awful! I thought he was gone forever--forever, do you
understand? Oh, the freedom, the rest--the peace! With his return has
come the shadow of an old, old grief. It blots out the sunshine.

My lips twitched as I attempted soothing words. I took her cold hands
and chafed them. Courage, I whispered. She shook her head, quivering,
panting and undone.

Oh, I was born to live! Courage? I have none!

She leaned forward and sunk her head on the pommel of the saddle. After
a time she swung toward me. Her hair swept about her flaming cheeks,
and veiled her burning eyes. She looked like some hunted wild thing.

I hate him, she hissed. He knows I hate him. He does not care.

We looked at each other.

But he cares for you, I stated.

No, no, she said, hastily, dont say that.

Again we scanned each others faces. I spoke impetuously:

You believe in Destiny. Well, so do I! But we are not weak
instruments. You know what I mean. What law of society compels you to
a bondage such as you hint at? You are a strong-minded woman. Now that
you know the worst you have weapons to fight with. As soon as you
look about you--when you come to face the facts, you will see this. I
struggled with my thoughts, then I threw wide my arms. God knows what
I am to say to you!

She lifted up her head. I have promised him to do nothing--to go on as
I have been--he will not molest me.

I half shrugged. He loves you; of course, you believe that.

He may. He protested that he did, when I told him I must go my way.

I heard her dully, my eyes on her face. She said a few more words
brokenly, that I scarce gave ear to. At the conclusion of them I looked
away to the purple wood vista. Why did it please God, I said, to
have you cross my path!

Tears filled her eyes. Those words did not sound like the words of a
friend.

But they are said. I moved away, she sat brooding. I mounted, and
came to her side. We are friends, we may be friends, surely! May I
come to see you?

Indeed you must come. Your visits will be welcome. She smiled, but
her smile was twisted and dubious. I expect great things of Wanza. She
will be my entertainer. She will cheer me. Have Joey come to me-- Her
voice failed her utterly. She was pale again as the syringa blooms at
her side.

We must push on, now, I said.

She gathered up her reins.

And so we rode side by side to the little shack on the shore of Hidden
Lake. But when she gave me her hand at parting, I stumblingly cried:
If he had not come--if he had not come, I should have tried to win
your love! Something in her eyes caused me to add: I wonder if I
should have succeeded.

She paled and drew her hand from mine. I could have loved you, David
Dale, she whispered.

That night when Joey was preparing for bed in the cedar room, I spied a
bit of ribbon the color of the gowns Wanza wore, wreathed in among the
grasses in the magpies cage. And at the sight Joey cried out:

Thats Wanzas. I want her! I want her to come back and stay, I do.

Holding the ribbon in my hand, I passed out to the Dingle.

Here I sat down on the stump by the pool, in a ring of black shadow
cast by the cedars, and lifted my face to the stars that were shining
through the wattled green roof above my head. I was worn, physically
and mentally, by the experiences of the day. I sat there stupidly,
scarce moving, letting my pipe go out as I fed my grief with memories.
Joey called out at intervals: Good night, Mr. David, dear. Each
time I responded: Good night, Joey. At last no sound came from the
cedar room. I knew he slept. It was very still in the Dingle. A toad
hopped across the stone walk and a grass-snake flashed through the
rose hedge, like a quick flame. Close to the pools brink the big
flag-flowers vacillated in a faint, upspringing breeze, and the rushes
swayed and shuddered above the timorous bluebells. The moon came up
slowly, and I saw its face through the tree spaces. I wondered if
Haidee were watching it from the shore of Hidden Lake. And then a naked
Desolation crept up out of an unknown void, and I saw the gleam of its
whitened bones. It gibed me. It trailed its bleached carcass across
my arid path. The hour grew hideous. I felt myself alone--grievously
alone--on the verge of utmost solitude, reaching out ineffectual hands
toward emptiness. I recoiled, my senses whirling, from the limitless
nothingness into which my vision pored.

I was clammy, with a cold sweat. My throat was dry. But the horror
passed and I grew apathetic at length, and sodden. Then calm, merely.
Soon I grew strangely somnolent. I nodded. But after a space I sat
tense, my chin sunk, listening. A vague stirring in the night chilled
my blood, and at the same time thrilled me. I listened and watched,
breathing heavily, alert and narrow-eyed.

And then!

I saw Wanza part the tangles of syringa, and stand pink-robed, framed
in white blossoms. Her face, rose-tinted and impassioned, was curtained
on either side by her unbound resplendent hair. Her eyes, laughing and
bright like happy stars, shone through the wilderness of locks. Her
lips, smooth and pink as polished coral, smiled freshly as the lips of
a tender child. Her arms were bare. In her strong brown hands she bore
a wooden cage, and the waxwing slept within, its head beneath its wing.
She hesitated, apparently saw no one--listened and heard no sound. She
spurned her flowered frame, and came springing forward, her short skirt
fluttering above her bare knees, her pink feet gleaming in the long
grasses.

She passed close to me. Noiselessly she swept to the steps of the
cedar room. She mounted. I saw her pass through the open doorway, where
there was a pale nimbus of light. I saw her at the window. She took the
magpies cage from its hook, and hung the waxwing there instead. Soon
she reappeared. She carried the magpie in its cage. She came down the
steps, and I heard a voice like a moon-drowned dream murmur roguishly:

I have left them the waxwing. But I have taken away the magpie, lest
it tell my secrets.

I would have stopped her. But she had sprung with fluttering, perfumed
haste through the syringa frame and vanished.

I dropped to the turf, clasped my arms about my head, and slept,
a deep, refreshing sleep. It was dawn when I awakened, a pink,
sweet-smelling dawn, scintillant with promise. I went to the cedar
room, Joey slept, one arm thrown out above his tousled head, the
shawl-flower quilt tossed aside. I covered him, and crossed to the
window.

The magpies cage swung in its accustomed place.

As I approached, the bird fixed me with its quick, bright eye, and
chortled:

Mr. David Dale! Fixing man! Mr. David--dear.

How strange that I should dream of Wanza!

       *       *       *       *       *

Dreary days followed for Joey and me.

As the days began to shorten I rode frequently to Captain Grifs in
the cool of the evening, taking Joey on the saddle behind me. And
each night Joey dropped asleep on the small bed in Wanzas room while
I played a rubber of chess with the captain. When Father OShan was
present a new zest was given our evenings.

One stormy night Father OShan, Joey and I were belated at the cottage,
and the father and I kept our good host up to an unconscionable hour in
the room beneath the eaves, while Joey slept peacefully on the lower
floor. Father OShan was in fine fettle, and his stories were pungent,
his drollery inimitable. As the storm began I rolled into the captains
bunk and lay there in vast contentment. The port hole was open, framing
an oval of purple sky and drifting cloud rack. My fantasy was so keen
that I could fairly smell the odor of bilge and stale fish and tar, and
hear the tramp of feet on the deck over my head. When the storm was at
its fiercest, and the little cottage shook and the lightning flashed
through the port hole, it was easy to cheat myself into the belief
that I was experiencing all the wild delights of a storm at sea.

The talk had turned on the superstitions of men who go down to the sea
in ships. Lonely men are superstitious men, the father said. There
is something about aloneness that engenders visions and superstitions.
People who dwell apart all have their visions.

And their madnesses, I interjected. People who live at the edge of
things are entitled to their superstitions. During the first months of
my life on my homestead, before Joeys advent, I had one or two narrow
squeaks--came within an ace of insanity, I believe now. I went so far
that like the man in the story I met myself coming round the corner of
the cabin one day. I pulled up then and went to the city for a month
and took a rather menial position.

Father OShan was looking at me curiously.

I never heard of that before, he said. You pulled through all right.

Oh, yes! If it had not been for my dog I might have gone under the
first year. But the dog was understanding.

A dog, Captain Grif explained carefully, is the instinctinest animal
there be--and the faithfulest.

I caught Father OShans eyes fixed on me ruminatingly from time to
time during the evening. Once or twice, meeting my eyes, he favored
me with his rare, heart-warming smile. When I said good night to him
in the village, leaning from the saddle and shifting Joeys sleeping
figure somewhat, in order that I might offer him my hand, he pressed
close to my horses side and peered up at me with friendly glance
through the semi-darkness of the dimly lighted street.

Too bad, Dale--too bad, he said in his winning tones.

Eh? Just what is too bad? I asked.

He gripped my hand.

Man, Im sorry I did not know you in the darkest days--when the dog
was understanding. Id have tried to be understanding, too. A pity,
Dale--a pity!

Never mind!

I shall pass through this world but once, you know--I dont want to
leave more things undone than I have to. But the unguessed things--that
lurk quite obscure--they have a way of unearthing themselves--they
hurt, Dale! Why, my boy, I rode past your cabin when you were putting
the roof on! But I was busy. I did not stop. Oh, well--Im glad you had
your dog!




CHAPTER XVIII

THANK YOU, MR. FIXING MAN


THE bathing and dressing of Joey on Sunday morning, with Sunday school
in prospect, had always been an indeterminate process, a sort of blind
bargain. But with each week that was added to his age it became not
only precarious, but downright fagging, and nerve racking to a degree.
When he was a wee urchin and could go into the wash tub in the kitchen
for his weekly scouring, the process was comparatively simple, but
now that his long legs precluded that possibility, a liberal soaping
and sponge bath beside the tub was the alternative, and I found the
operation decidedly ticklish.

He knew the minuti of the bath so well that if I neglected the least
detail, or varied the prescribed form, I was called to severe account.

On the Sunday morning following our late evening at Captain Grifs we
arose late, and consequently there was a scramble to get our breakfast
over and the water heated for the bath. But in due time all the
preliminaries were adjusted and Joey, stripped to the waist, knelt down
beside the tub according to our usual custom, that I might first give
his hair a thorough washing.

You shouldnt rub soap on it, he demurred, as I turned to the soap
dish. Bell Brandon says so. She says thats what makes my hair so
brash and funny.

Brash, Joey?

Thats what she said.

My jaw dropped. How shall we get it clean, boy?

You make a lather. Shave off little chunks of soap and put em in a
bottle and shake em up with water.

These directions were followed, and both Joey and I were gratified with
the result, but precious moments were consumed in the process.

After that Joey got water in his ear, and had to dance like a Piute,
on one leg, and shake his head until it was dislodged. Next he sat on
the side of the tub and tipped it sufficiently to deluge the floor with
half the contents. This necessitated a scurry for the mop, and when
I rather curtly declined the lads services, tears came to the brown
eyes, his head drooped, and quite a quarter of an hour was expended
in salving his feelings, submitting to bear hugs and listening to
assurances that he had not meant to spill his bath water.

After that we got down to business, and I stood Joey in the tub, soaped
him well, soused him with the sponge quickly, and rubbed him with a
coarse towel until his small body was in a glow. As I was drying his
feet, he said gently:

I guess Im a little boy yet, aint I, Mr. David? I guess its a good
thing you know how to take care of me.

He rubbed his cheek against my arm.

Wheres your shirt, boy?

He pointed.

Oh, such a pitiful, faded, abject blue and white rag it seemed,
hanging on the chair back! I turned it this way and that, regarding it
dubiously.

Will it do, Joey?

Why, yes, sure itll do. My, course itll do.

I sighed. Well have to get some new ones when you start to school,
boy.

Well, but when I wear the tie Bell Brandon gave me, who sees the
shirt, he said absently.

I looked around at him. He was inspecting a red, angry looking mark
on his chest. Will that always be there, Mr. David? he asked
plaintively, touching it. It always has been there. What makes it?

Its a birth mark, Joey. If ever you should get stolen, and when I
found you a bad man should say: Hes not your boy, I could answer:
My boy has a round red mark on his chest. See how fine that would be.

Joey laughed, and held out his arms for the shirt.

A few minutes later I was arranging the gaily striped Windsor tie
beneath the turn down collar of the worn shirt, when the familiar sound
of creaking harness and whirring wheels reached my ear. Wanza had not
paid Cedar Dale a visit since the day she went away in tearful silence
bearing the waxwing with her.

When I opened the door and saw her radiant face my spirits lightened
suddenly, and a spray of sunshine seemed to sweeten the dingy kitchen
as she stepped over the threshold.

Am I in time? she breathed.

In time? In time for what, Wanza? I asked.

She dropped a bundle on to the table.

In time for Joey to wear one of these to Sunday school? she said,
portentously.

Joey crept closer. Her eyes as they turned to him were blue as summer
skies and as shining. She snapped the string that held the bundle
intact. Joey and I saw an amazing array of small shirts--checked
shirts, striped shirts, white shirts.

Where--where did they come from, Wanza? stammered Joey.

But I had guessed.

Well, its the first real present Ive ever made you, Joey. It sure
wont be the last! Hustle into the cedar room now, and get into the
white one with the frills--the white ones are for Sunday school.

I could say nothing. And as for Joey, he gathered the shirts in his
arms and went away to the cedar room snivelling. Wanza and I were left
to look into each others faces questioningly. How is it with you,
Wanza? I asked, just as she put the query, How do you get along, Mr.
Dale?

We both laughed, and the awkwardness of the situation was relieved.

I miss you terribly, Wanza, I confessed. My sour dough bread turns
to dust and ashes in my mouth.

Her soft eyes were commiserating. Ill fetch you a good sweet loaf of
my baking, now and then, she volunteered quickly.

And dont drive by as you have been doing. Are you too busy to stop as
you used to do, girl? I asked.

Im busy, all right. She lifted the cover from a small tin pail on
the back of the stove, and sniffed with the air of a connoisseur at the
yeast it contained. That needs more sugar!

It needs doctoring, I conceded ruefully. I set it last night and it
has not risen.

Has Joey been having his bath here?

Yes.

She looked about her.

Ill straighten around a bit, I believe. Empty that tub, and open the
windows, Mr. Dale, and Ill get the broom and give the cabin a thorough
cleaning. And then before I go Ill set some yeast for you thatll
raise the cover off the pail in no time.

Later as I was holding the dust pan for Wanza, Joey came from the cedar
room fresh and smiling in the white shirt, the Windsor tie in his hand.
Wanza laid aside her broom, and with deft fingers fastened the tie into
a wonderful bow beneath the boys chin. He kissed us both, and we went
with him to the meadow bars where Buttons was tethered. I lifted him
to the saddle and stood looking after him with a thrill of pride as
he rode away. In his new white shirt and clean corduroy trousers, with
his hair carefully brushed and his adorable brown face aglow and his
big bright eyes radiant with happiness he was a charming enough picture
of boyhood; and a prick of pleasure so sharp as to be almost pain ran
through me as he jauntily blew me a kiss, and cried:

I have my penny for the cradle-roll lady, and I have not forgot my
handkerchief.

That night I dropped asleep in the Dingle and again I dreamed of Wanza.
She came in her pink gown and bare feet as she had come before; but
this time she carried loaves of steaming, sweet-smelling bread in her
arms; and she came straight to my side, saying: This bread is sweet
and wholesome, you poor, poor fellow. It seemed to me that she knelt
and fed me portions of the bread with pitying fingers. And never had
morsel tasted more sweet.

As the days went by, in spite of Wanzas promises, the girl came but
seldom to Cedar Dale. And when I met her on the river road or in the
village, she seemed distrait and strangely shy and awkward, and vastly
uncommunicative, so that I felt forlorn enough; and I was wholly out of
touch with my wonder woman.

I applied myself feverishly to my writing. All day long I labored in my
shop, in order to earn the daily bread for Joey and myself, but each
night I wrote. The novel was almost finished; and something told me it
was good.

The weeks passed, and August was waning. The foliage was yellowing
along the river that crawled like a golden, sluggish serpent in and
out among the brittle rushes. September was waiting with lifted paint
brush. The beauty of the dreamy, ripe hours made my senses ache. The
earth seemed to lie in a trembling sleep, folded in fiery foliage. The
hills were plumed with trees of flame. At night the moons face was
warm and red, all day the sun burned copper colored through a light
blue haze.

There was something melting and dreamy in the days as they slipped
past--days when I found it hard to labor in the shop--the woods were
melodious still with bird voices, and all outdoors called to me.

I took a weeks vacation and fished hard by the village, where the
stream threads the meadows; companioned by Father OShan, I rode
along the river bank in the sunset and tramped the illumined fields
starred with sumach, and in the moonlight during that week, I sometimes
allowed myself to drift in my canoe on the river, thinking, thinking,
of Haidee--of the narrow oval of her face curtained in dark hair
streams, of the shadowy eyes of her, of her sweet warm smile.

And then one day I made up my mind suddenly to go to her.

At the first glimpse I had of her cabin, standing a crude, warped,
misshapen thing on the slight rise of ground beneath the cedars, all my
former resolves to give to this habitation some slight air of comfort
and refinement rose up and confronted me, and I saw myself a weak
fellow, who had nursed his despair and disappointment and failed in
his duty to the woman he loved, and who in his cowardice had absented
himself from his loved one, when he might have brought her comfort and
neighborly assistance.

On the back of an old envelope with a stub of a pencil I made a rough
sketch of the improvements I had long since planned, and when Haidee
and Wanza came to the door, I greeted them calmly and showed them the
sketch. Haidee stood there, without her crutches, her hair unbound
about her ivory face. Her gown was white, and a scarf of rose color
swung from her shoulders. She looked at me for a long moment with eyes
dull and faded as morning stars, and then gradually the old familiar
light came back into her face, her eyes warmed and grew human. She
stepped outside, and joined me on the porch.

You have laid aside your crutches? I ventured.

Yes.

You are well? I asked.

Oh, yes! I work--hard--at various things. Do I not, Wanza? I sleep. I
have a splendid appetite. And you?

I work. I sleep well, too. I drop asleep in the Dingle occasionally
after a hard days work. The Dingle is Wanzas retreat--she walks
there. Do you know it, Wanza?

She came to my side quickly. Her face displayed signs of perturbation.
I walk there! What do you mean? Have you seen me?

You come on tip-toe. It is hardly walking.

Her eyes questioned me.

Ive seen you only a few times. But I suspect you come frequently.

I am sure I dont, Mr. David Dale.

She came closer, her cheeks like crimson roses, her bright eyes angry,
her lips scornful.

You come to visit Joey, I think. You came the first night after your
departure from Cedar Dale. And you went into the cedar room. I smiled
into her troubled face.

And what did I do there?

You took the magpies cage from its hook. You carried it away with
you. But you were like a little trade rat--you left the cedar waxwing
for Joey and me.

But just here Wanza flung me an odd look and ran into the house, saying
over her shoulder: That was a funny, funny dream.

Haidee favored me with a rather intent look, and dropped her gaze to
the envelope in her hand. We walked around the cabin, and I explained
how I planned to build a small rustic pergola with a trellis for wild
honeysuckle at the back door to serve as a breakfast room next summer,
and timidly at last, I told her that I wished that I might cover the
rough walls of her sleeping room with cedar strips and build a pergola
outside the door like the one I had built at Cedar Dale for Joey.

Well plant some woodbine roots this fall, and set out a crimson
rambler. We may as well have the place blooming like an Eden, I said.

And the wilderness shall blossom like the rose, murmured Haidee.
Thank you, Mr. Fixing Man.

I rode home happier than I had been in many a long day. When I told
Joey of the proposed improvements at Hidden Lake he shouted with glee,
and a few moments later I heard him tooting on his neglected flute
that had lain strangely mute since the day when Haidee had sung Bell
Brandon to its accompaniment, and we had seen the smile die from her
curling lips and the light of joy go out in her sparkling eyes.

After this my days were trances. Through the glowing flame-like
hours I worked to transform the sordid little cabin into a fitting
habitation for my wonder woman. Together we planned the rustic porch
at the rear of the kitchen, and when the foundation was la
