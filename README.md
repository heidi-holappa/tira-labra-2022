# Introduction
This project is being built as a university course project during Summer 2022 for the laboratory class of Data Structures and Algorithms. I propose doing my project on lossless data compression.

The initial proposal is to do a comparison on two well known algorithms, Huffman coding and LZ77. For more detailed proposal please see 'Requirements specification.' For detailed report on the projects first week see 'Weekly Report #1.'
