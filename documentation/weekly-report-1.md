## What have I done this week?
I made a conscious choice to prioritize last courses of period IV this week (last course has a deadline on Sunday). I give my word to make up for any missing hours next week. With that said, I personally am satisfied with what I have accomplished this week. 

Choosing the topic was the most difficult thing on this first week. There were so many exciting possibilities and I spent a long time on thinking about pros and cons of different decisions. At the moment I have a feeling that for example path finding algorithms could prove very useful later on in my future professional career. Should I focus on them to get as much experience on something that could perhaps be useful later on? On the other hand music has always been a part of my life. Should I use this opportunity to create something that could provide value to my dear hobby? Or should I use this opportunity to study something that interests me academically, even if I am uncertain of what future use I'd have for that knowledge? 

I opted to choose the last one and focus on data compression algorithms. It is a topic that has long fascinated me and I wanted to take this opportunity to understand a bit more about how they work. At the moment I am uncertain, whether this knowledge will be professionally useful in the future, but I try to keep my mind open right now and to pursue topics that fascinate and motivate me. My reasoning is that I am already highly motivated on investing time on studying path finding algorithms and I will find opportunities to study that. I might, however, miss out on learning about data compression if I didn't use one of the available opportunities to put time and effort on a fascinating topic that may or may not prove useful later on. 

This week I have studied about data compression and scraped the surface on the fascinating topic. I have decided that my project will focus on lossless data compression. In the course material a comparison of Huffman vs. Lempel-Ziv was given as an example of a good scope for this project and I decided to start by looking into these two algorithms.

During this first week I have created a project and a remote repository to GitHub. I have to best of my knowledge and understanding fulfilled included everything that was asked to the  requirements specification documentation. 

I have also initialized Poetry and added Pylint, Pytest, Invoke and Coverage for future purposes. 

## How has the application progressed?
This week the core content application has not yet progressed. I did however create an initial template for the GUI, which can already be tested by downloading the project. I used my previous work from the OhTe-course to setup the main layout, menu structure and theme configuration that I personally created this spring. I considered that reusing my own work in this way is acceptable, as the GUI is merely a tool to make focusing on the purpose of this course more convenient. 

I have made an initial proposal for the application structure, which can be found in the requirements specification documentation. 

## What did I learn during this week / today?
I learned...

## What remained unclear or caused difficulties? 
I am at this time uncertain on whether I chose a good starting point for this project. It was relatively easy to find pseudocode examples of the two algorithms I propose focusing on (Huffman coding, LZ77). I estimated that the sources seemed trustworthy, but I have a certain amount of uncertainty nevertheless. I would very much appreciate on hearing feedback on this. Taking in to consideration that my goal is the get a good grade (at the least a 5), 

* is the scope good for this project? 
* are my initial sources a good starting point? 

## Next steps
During next week I will start building the application. The initial idea is to have a rough GUI ready and first working versions of the algorithms ready for use.
