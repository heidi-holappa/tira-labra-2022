## What have I done this week?
I made a conscious choice to prioritize last courses of period IV this week (last course has a deadline on Sunday). I give my word to make up for any missing hours next week. With that said, I personally am satisfied with what I have accomplished this week. 

Choosing the topic was the most difficult thing on this first week. There were so many exciting possibilities and I spent a long time on thinking about pros and cons of different decisions. At the moment I have a feeling that for example path finding algorithms could prove very useful later on in my future professional career. Should I focus on them to get as much experience on something that could perhaps be useful later on? On the other hand music has always been a part of my life. Should I use this opportunity to create something that could provide value to my dear hobby? Or should I use this opportunity to study something that interests me academically, even if I am uncertain of what future use I'd have for that knowledge? 

I opted to choose the last one and focus on data compression algorithms. It is a topic that has long fascinated me and I wanted to take this opportunity to understand a bit more about how they work. At the moment I am uncertain, whether this knowledge will be professionally useful in the future, but I try to keep my mind open right now and to pursue topics that fascinate and motivate me. My reasoning is that I am already highly motivated on investing time on studying path finding algorithms and I will find opportunities to study that. I might, however, miss out on learning about data compression if I didn't use one of the available opportunities to put time and effort on a fascinating topic that may or may not prove useful later on. 

This week I have studied about data compression and scraped the surface on the fascinating topic. I have decided that my project will focus on lossless data compression. In the course material a comparison of Huffman vs. Lempel-Ziv was given as an example of a good scope for this project and I decided to start by looking into these two algorithms.

I have created a project and a remote repository to GitHub. I have created a requirements specification documentation and did my best to include everything asked for. I have also initialized Poetry and added Pylint, Pytest, Invoke and Coverage for future purposes. 

## How has the application progressed?
This week the application has not yet progressed.
