# Weekly Report #6

## Quick recap on progress
- Continued optimization. A 15MB file containing the Top 10 books from Project Gutenberg can be compressed and uncompressed in a reasonable time. 
- Tests are now divided into two different groups:
  - Fast tests: these are now ran every time the application starts
  - Extended tests: tests for large files (size over 1MB). 
- Changed UI-layout, simplified compression/uncompression functionalities.
